I once worked with an organization that developed five year strategic plans, while at the same time teaching it's employees that we live in volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) world. Do you see the irony?

In the investing and asset management world, your revenue is related to assets under management. When the value of those assets fluctuates your revenue does as well. Enlightened organizations in this space create rolling eighteen-month budgets that are revised every six months with a flexible strategic overlay. This works much better in a "VUCA" world.

> “Your people want and need to engage with the world that they’re really in, and to interact with the world as it really is. By harnessing them to a prefabricated plan, you’re not only constraining your people but, quite possibly, also revealing how out of touch with reality you are.”

Many plans, particularly those created in large organizations, are overly generalized, quickly obsolete, and frustrating to those asked to execute them. It’s far better to coordinate your team’s efforts in real time, relying heavily on the informed, detailed intelligence of each unique team member.

Tell story of davis patraeus... instead of planning system you create an "intelligence" system.

In May 2009, before McChrystal arrived, US SOF were carrying out 20 raids per month. By October 2009, JSOC had scaled to 90 raids per month, the target list for SOF night raids, called the Joint Prioritized Effects List (JPEL), included 2,058 names, according to one of the Afghan war logs documents released by WikiLeaks. In April 2011, a US military source told researchers for the Open Society Foundations and The Liaison Center that as many as 40 raids were being carried out _every night_ – a rate of more than 1,000 raids per month. The intelligence system allowed the number of raids to scale by a factor of **fifty**.

McChrystal's command gathered intelligence on al-Qaeda and Mahdi Army personnel from three well-known technologies: 24-hour surveillance by drone aircraft, monitoring of mobile phone traffic and pinpointing the physical location of the phones from their signals. McChrystal's intelligence chief Col. Michael Flynn liked to call surveillance by drone aircraft “The Unblinking Eye” – an image suggesting a godlike power of observation. To convert the raw data obtained from drone surveillance and tracking mobile phone calls into intelligence on who to target, Flynn turned to a tool called “social network analysis.” In the wake of the 9/11 attacks, that technique had became almost overnight the favored tool for analyzing terrorist and insurgent networks. It provided a framework for construction of models of networks by measuring the number of direct interactions between individuals or “nodes.” With a quantitative tool called “link analysis” and accompanying software, intelligence analysts could see the raw data from drone surveillance and links among telephones transformed into a “map” of the insurgent “network” in each locality.

## On the Other Hand...

You do need some type of management tool that outlines your priorities. You have to communicate to others what your team is doing! The key is building in flexibility to react to change. What are "must do" activities vs. "want to" activities?

Jack Welch eliminated strategic planning:

From 1981 to 1990, GE freed up over $11 billion by selling off more than 200 underperforming businesses. Within the company, Welch sought to streamline GE with layoffs, eliminating the laborious strategic planning system, dismantling the bureaucracy, and abolishing the nine-layer management hierarchy.
