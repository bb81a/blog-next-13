title: Planning vs. Reacting
excerpt: 'Do you how bees communicate with each other to share information about food sources? The bees communicate this critical information by performing a type of dance called the waggle dance. The other bees then follow the instructions and go harvest the flowers. Yet, some bees ignore the dance. Why?'

I once worked with an organization that developed five year strategic plans, while at the same time teaching it's employees that we live in volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) world. Do you see the irony?

In the investing and asset management world, your revenue is related to assets under management. When the value of those assets fluctuates your revenue does as well. Enlightened organizations in this space create rolling eighteen-month budgets that are revised every six months with a flexible strategic overlay. This works much better in a "VUCA" world.

> “Your people want and need to engage with the world that they’re really in, and to interact with the world as it really is. By harnessing them to a prefabricated plan, you’re not only constraining your people but, quite possibly, also revealing how out of touch with reality you are.”

## On the Other Hand...

You do need some type of management tool that outlines your priorities. You have to communicate to others what your team is doing! The key is building in flexibility to react to change. What are "must do" activities vs. "want to" activities?
