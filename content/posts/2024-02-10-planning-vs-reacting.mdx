I once worked with an organization that developed detailed five year strategic plans, while at the same time teaching it's employees that we live in volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous ([VUCA](https://hbr.org/2014/01/what-vuca-really-means-for-you)) world. The company completed it's latest strategic plan in 2019, for the period 2020-25 (right before COVID 19 arrived). Do you see the irony?

Many "strategies", "plans", or "strategic plans", particularly those created in large organizations, are overly generalized, quickly become obsolete, and frustrating to those asked to execute them. Sometimes they are fuzzy and hard to measure such as "recognized leader in [insert industry here] industry".

> “For example, Chen Brothers was a rapidly growing regional distributor of specialty foods. Its overall goals included growing profit, being a good place to work, and being seen as the go-to distributor for organic foods. These were all worthy goals. None of them, however, implied a particular strategy or action, although they can be seen as constraints (that is, these sorts of broad “goals” work like the rules of football in that they rule out a great many actions without specifying what the team should actually do).”

Typically, the goals of Chen Brothers would be translated into a list of specific actions. Such lists usually grow out of planning meetings in which a wide variety of stakeholders provide input (usually their own pet projects). Rather than focus on a few important items (and ignore anyone's pet), the group sweeps the whole collection into the “strategic plan.” Then, in recognition that the entire list is unachievable, the label “long-term” is added so that none of them need be done today.

As it happens, no research exists showing that goals set for you from above stimulate you to greater productivity. In fact, the weight of evidence suggests that cascaded goals do the opposite: they limit performance.

> “Your people want and need to engage with the world that they’re really in, and to interact with the world as it really is. By harnessing them to a prefabricated plan, you’re not only constraining your people but, quite possibly, also revealing how out of touch with reality you are.”

## How to Balance Planning vs Reacting?

In a VUCA world, what’s the point of strategy and planning? The fact that strategic plans can go stale doesn't mean we should not plan at all.

The best companies don’t just cascade _goals_; the best companies cascade _meaning and focus_. A list of “goals” or “things to do”, mislabeled as “strategies”, is _not a strategy_. It is just a list of things to do.

## Share "Real Time" Intelligence AND Goals

Your company needs to be able to react while it's "in the fight". It needs to adapt to market conditions as they are _today_, not what you projected two years ago.

Many plans, particularly those created in large organizations, are overly generalized, quickly obsolete, and frustrating to those asked to execute them. It’s far better to coordinate your team’s efforts in real time, relying heavily on the informed, detailed intelligence of each unique team member.

Tell story of davis patraeus... instead of planning system you create an "intelligence" system.

In May 2009, before McChrystal arrived, US SOF were carrying out 20 raids per month. By October 2009, JSOC had scaled to 90 raids per month, the target list for SOF night raids, called the Joint Prioritized Effects List (JPEL), included 2,058 names, according to one of the Afghan war logs documents released by WikiLeaks. In April 2011, a US military source told researchers for the Open Society Foundations and The Liaison Center that as many as 40 raids were being carried out _every night_ – a rate of more than 1,000 raids per month. The intelligence system allowed the number of raids to scale by a factor of **fifty**.

McChrystal's command gathered intelligence on al-Qaeda and Mahdi Army personnel from three well-known technologies: 24-hour surveillance by drone aircraft, monitoring of mobile phone traffic and pinpointing the physical location of the phones from their signals. McChrystal's intelligence chief Col. Michael Flynn liked to call surveillance by drone aircraft “The Unblinking Eye” – an image suggesting a godlike power of observation. To convert the raw data obtained from drone surveillance and tracking mobile phone calls into intelligence on who to target, Flynn turned to a tool called “social network analysis.” In the wake of the 9/11 attacks, that technique had became almost overnight the favored tool for analyzing terrorist and insurgent networks. It provided a framework for construction of models of networks by measuring the number of direct interactions between individuals or “nodes.” With a quantitative tool called “link analysis” and accompanying software, intelligence analysts could see the raw data from drone surveillance and links among telephones transformed into a “map” of the insurgent “network” in each locality.

## On the Other Hand...

You do need some type of management tool that outlines your priorities. You have to communicate to others what your team is doing! The key is building in flexibility to react to change. What are "must do" activities vs. "want to" activities?

Jack Welch eliminated strategic planning:

From 1981 to 1990, GE freed up over $11 billion by selling off more than 200 underperforming businesses. Within the company, Welch sought to streamline GE with layoffs, eliminating the laborious strategic planning system, dismantling the bureaucracy, and abolishing the nine-layer management hierarchy.
