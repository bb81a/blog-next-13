Companies say they want engaged employees. Engagement seems like a pretty low bar. Funny, I’ve never heard an employee say they wanted to be "engaged". Personally, I'd much rather be inspired.

Inspiration goes far beyond engagement. The definition of inspiration is literally "the process of being _mentally stimulated_ do or feel something, especially _to do something creative_." Isn't inspiration what we really want?

If you’re inspired on a Friday, use the weekend to dive in. When you’re high on inspiration, you can get two weeks of work done in 24 hours. Inspiration literally brings the future forward. **It's a time machine.**

Inspiration is a now thing. If it grabs you, grab it right back and put it to work! Inspiration has a shelf-life. Inspiration doesn’t last forever. If you want to do something, you’ve got to do it now. You can’t wait two months to get around to it. You can’t just say you’ll do it later. Later, you won’t be pumped up about it anymore.

Inspiration comes with assembly required, with incomplete instructions and parts missing. It's a puzzle. It's a challenge. What is fun about inspiration is that it is uncertain. Uncertainty drives creativity, and don't we all want more of that?

I don't expect too much from most companies, but then I also believe most inspiration comes from within. My advice is simple: Don't wait for opportunities to be given to you. By the time an opportunity is handed to you, it is no longer an opportunity, _it is a test_. You will pass or fail based on what _someone else_ saw as an opportunity.

Most opportunities don’t announce themselves. You must seek them out. You hunt them. You have to seek inspiration. Have you read anything lately that inspired you? Do you have an itch to try something deep down, but you keep ignoring it? Why not grab a cup of coffee and think about the very first step you'd take - all journeys start with the first step.
