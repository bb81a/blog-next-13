The concept of a "peacetime" and "wartime" CEO was popularized by [Ben Horowitz](https://a16z.com/peacetime-ceo-wartime-ceo/), cofounder of Andreessen Horowitz.

> Peacetime in business means those times when a company has a large advantage vs. the competition in its core market, and its market is growing. In times of peace, the company can focus on expanding the market and reinforcing the company’s strengths.
>
> In wartime, a company is fending off an imminent existential threat. Such a threat can come from a wide range of sources including competition, dramatic macro economic change, market change, supply chain change, and so forth.

Ben's key message is that peacetime and wartime require radically different management styles. There is a corollary for CIOs - especially when taking on the CIO role for the first time, or taking over an existing technology team. As an effective CIO, you never just take a job. You are accepting a mission. You need to know from the outset if the mission is to take the hill (upswing work) or to stop the slide (turnaround work).

How is the current technology organization viewed by the wider company, and especially other leaders? How much shadow technology is happening in business areas? What changes do the CEO and other leaders want to see? How is technology effectiveness measured?

If you are fortunate the company and the technology team are facing the challenges of growth and you have a realtively healthy technology organization. One where you can reinforce it's strengths, unleash it's talent, and build new cool stuff using modern technology and methods. Congratulations, you get to be a peacetime CIO.

If you come into an organization headed downhill you will not last if your strategy is simple change leadership. They need more than just change, and you need to set different expectations with the company when they hire you. You are not coming in to make changes, you are coming in to do a turnaround. In short, you need to be a wartime CIO.

Turnarounds mean that you must address:

- Systemic issues (roots of failure, key points of fear)
- Political issues (undue influencers, excused behaviors, entrenched perspectives, shadow IT)
- Embedded dysfunctions (culture, tradition, beliefs, habits)
- Talent gaps (or lack thereof)
- Strategic errors (or lack of strategy)

If you bring change without transforming the environment itself, nothing you do will be sustainable. When I have led turnarounds, I made it clear that I wasn’t coming to just make changes. I was coming to address the core issues that all change requires to be effective. And that takes a different mindset.

Yes, you must address immediate needs and long-term technology strategy and vision. More so, you are reversing the downward trajectory by starting a new curve.

<span className="text-sm">
  Douglas MacArthur received 13 awards for bravery, including the Medal of
  Honor. Perhaps the most gifted wartime soldier America ever produced, he
  orchestrated remarkable victories in France, New Guinea, the Philippines, and
  Korea. He often led from the front, sharing the dangers of the battlefield
  with his men, which earned him accolades for bravery and the loyalty of his
  soldiers. His tenure was marked by the challenge of leading the Army during
  the Great Depression, a period of limited resources and low morale. Despite
  this, he advocated for a modern, mechanized army, foreseeing the changing
  nature of warfare.
