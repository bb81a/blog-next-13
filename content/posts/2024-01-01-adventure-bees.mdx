Do you how bees communicate with each other to share information about food sources? The bees communicate this critical information by performing a type of _dance_. Itâ€™s called the waggle dance.

When a worker bee dances for its fellow workers, it uses certain movements, and angles its body in a specific pattern, to tell the others where it found nectar and pollen-rich flowers. The other bees then follow the instructions from the dance and go harvest the food.

Amazing right? 

But this isn't the end of the story.  See, if _all_ the bees go and harvest the same food source it will soon be depleted - and the hive might starve.

## Adventure Bees

Some bees ignore the dance. "Adventure bees" do their own thing. They don't do what the other bees tell them to do - they are mavericks. They like to explore.

They say to themselves:

>"Bob B. just told us about a great food supply 30 yards away due north. I should listen to Bob and go harvest those flowers -- but I am an adventure bee. I am an explorer, a pioneer. I am going to ignore Bob and go on my own adventure. I may not find anything but maybe I will find a new food supply even better!"

Not all bees can, or should, be adventure bees - A hive needs most workers to follow instructions and go harvest the known food supplies. If all the bees ignored the waggle dance the hive would soon starve too. 

An adventure bee has very little downside to the hive. They may wander off from the hive, and may go hungry for a while, but their upside is almost unlimited. Having a few adventure bees is healthy for the hive overall because they find the _new_ food supplies.

Your organization needs a few adventure bees.  However, many human resource processes are designed to weed out adventure bees. They encourage drones that follow instructions. Or more broadly, Human Resource's focus leans toward conformity to a common core set of behaviors, and a common set of skills that "align" to the mission of the company.

If you agree you need a few adventure bees you should know that giving some of your people the leeway to ignore what everyone else is doing and go exploring is harder than you might think. Hopefully, the upside potential helps you see the challenge as worthy.

First, you have to identify and protect them. You may have to shield them from HR, and you will have to figure out how to rate their success and reward them. Going on an adventure and not finding a new food supply isn't a failure - it's just one area searched and ruled out. However, some in your organization will still see it as a failure. In some ways your adventure bees will have to see the adventure as part of the reward. 

Another challenge you will face is defending them against other people that are not "allowed" to be adventure bees and have to follow the existing norms, rules and processes. This is also harder than you think because of people's emotions and feelings about what is fair and equitable. It takes both courage and leadership to sponsor a few adventure bees.

Who are **your** adventure bees? Are you helping them succeed?
