title: About Me
description: I love building things. Made in California. Family man, technologist and Hacker News aficionado. Eternally curious.

I have been very fortunate in my career to have experienced several major waves of technology innovation, including the birth of the Internet (really). I have served in a variety of senior leadership roles, including Global CIO of Allianz Global Investors where I was accountable for over $500M USD in annual technology spend. I held a leadership role within Accenture where I led a team of over 100 people who digitally transformed a trillion-dollar mutual fund manager’s complete set of trading, settlement, portfolio accounting, fund performance & risk measurement systems. I also helped launch the first Internet Bank Wingspan Bank.

I have been a Chief Information Officer/Chief Technology Officer for a long time and it’s clear that "managing information" is just the price of entry. In today’s world CIO should mean "Chief Innovation Officer". It's what I love about my work.

What is interesting about me is I am still a "hands-on" leader and I love the challenges of creating something new. I have over 150 code repositories on GitHub; spanning many different languages and technologies. I actually still miss my days as a programmer where I could focus on a single problem domain.

I also have a User Guide if you really want to know more about me and how I work.
