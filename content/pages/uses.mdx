- [Privacy Badger](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/privacy-badger/pkehgijcmpdhfbdbbnkijodmdjhbjlgp) - Privacy Badger automatically discovers trackers based on their behavior.

If trackers ignore your wishes, Privacy Badger will learn to block them.
- [uBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm) - uBlock Origin is more than an "ad blocker", it's a wide-spectrum content blocker with CPU and memory efficiency as a primary feature.
