Placing a post how to install Python on Windows, along with a picture of your favorite band and an assessment of Apple's business strategy all in the same place means you probably won't appeal to anyone in particular. However a blog called \"Ant Farm\" that has _every_ post focused on raising healthy and happy ants - well that will build an audience for sure. So if you have, or want, separate audiences you will need separate blogs.\n\n## My Audiences\n\n1. _Personal:_ personal thoughts, pictures, etc. (Is this even necessary in the Facebook era?)\n2. _WanderingCIO:_ Blog about more strategic thoughts and ideas regarding managing technology\n3. _Technical Stuff:_ \"How to\" type posts. Stuff I want to remember and I might as well share. How to install Ruby on Windows for example.\n\n## Linkage\n\n1. Personal Blog > Personal Twitter > Personal Facebook (somehow this should all reinforce)\n2. WanderingCIO > WanderingCIO Twitter (Engagement) **Do I really want to maintain a seperate blog for this?** My name should be my brand shouldn't it?\n3. Technical Blog (it's out there if anyone wants to search for it)\n4. Company site > Company blog > Company Twitter > Company Facebook (somehow this should all reinforce the brand and create engagement)\n\n### Weapons of Choice / Stakes in the ground\n\n[Markdown][1]. Why? All the cool kids are using it. Markdown syntax is easy to read and learn. It's completely independent of what system you use because it's actually just a plain text file. This way all you need is an editor that can edit plain text. This means it's very portable. I also don't want my blog posts to become mired in someone else's blogging platform/system. I want to have the content easily and readily accessible anywhere, which leads me to my next choice.\n\n[Dropbox][2]. This is where I will store my raw posts as well as my blog image files. This way they are accessible across all platforms and devices.\n\n> **PROTIP:**\n> You can serve your blog images directly from Dropbox no matter where\n> your posts actually end up being published (and the links don't change).\n> The caveat is they must be in your Dropbox \"public\" folder somewhere.\n>\n> I created a \"blog-images\" sub-folder and just drop the images there.\n> Then you just right click the file on Dropbox and select \"copy public\n> link\". Dropbox even has a URL shortening service so they can also\n> give you a shortened link.\n\n### Blogging Engines\n\n1. Wordpress. The grandaddy. The OG. Tons of addins, plugins and whatnot.\n2. Tumblr. Can use [markdown][1] as a post format. Pretty much full control over your theme as long as you know HTML and CSS.\n3. Roll your own, use a static blog engine. Static blog engines turn markdown files into a useable blog. Jekyll might be the most widely used engine out there. Octopress is a framework based on Jekyll. Octopress comes with HTML templates, CSS, Javascript and a default configuration/theme that you can start to use right away.\n4. [Scriptogr.am][3] and [Calepin.co/][4] are two online services using markdown and dropbox to host your blog. Neither is very polished yet. Scriptogr.am is far more developed but I can't seem to delete my test account.\n\n### Hosting\n\n1. Github (free)\n2. Heroku (free)\n3. Amazon S3 and optionally CloudFront (cheap)\n\n### More About Tumblr\n\n#### Tumblr Themes\n\nGithub is great resource: https://github.com/search?q=tumblr&ref=cmdform&type=Repositories\nDocs:\n\n- http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/custom_themes\n\nCommercial:\n\n- Provenance Theme is my favorite http://provenance-theme.tumblr.com/\n\n### More About Wordpress\n\n#### Themes\n\n[Studiopress][3] Genesis Framework is recommended by [Yoast][4].\nI like these themes:\n\n- http://my.studiopress.com/themes/minimum/\n- http://demo.appfinite.com/epik/hello-world/\n\n### Engagement\n\n- _Disqus_ - I am convinced that allowing/encouraging people to comment is a good thing. So then the question becomes what comment system and do you plan to moderate? I really like Disqus.\n- _Mailchimp_ - specifically you want to a) allow people to sign up for blog posts by email. b) deliver new posts to the people who signed up! Steps go something like this: create list, create custom form so people can add themselves to the list, then use http://mailchimp.com/features/rss-to-email/ to create automatic emails.\n- _Twitter_ - Do you want to Tweet every post?\n- _Facebook_ - Do you want to post on Facebook also?\n\n### References\n\n[1]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\n[2]: http://www.dropbox.com\n[3]: http://www.studiopress.com/\n[4]: http://yoast.com/schema-org-genesis-2-0/\n",
