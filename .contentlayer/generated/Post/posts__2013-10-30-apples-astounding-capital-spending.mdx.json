He has a chart that tracks capital expenditure against iOS device volume and they track very closely. But I think the relationship may be somewhat coincidental.\n\nConsider Apple's desire to move away from Samsung. Be it on displays or in chips, I suspect this strategic direction is increasing CAPEX significantly without any corresponding unit sale increases.\n\nI also suspect the new campus has a significant impact. In addition we must consider the data centers Apple has been building over the last 2 years to support it's cloud services - clearly not production related CAPEX.\n\nLogically a portion of 2014 CAPEX is going to new device development and production - the iPhone 6 will very likely have a new form-factor and design. The iPod line needs a refesh. But the iPad Mini and iPad Air in my opinion will remain as is in 2014. So is the iPhone and iPod enough to drive CAPEX up that strongly? I doubt it.\n\n[Earlier this week, Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said the company is working on new releases in technology categories where it doesn’t yet compete.](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-30/apple-s-capital-spending-to-rise-to-11-billion-for-fiscal-2014.html) So perhaps an iWatch or an iTV is what is driving this spend. But maybe there is something really revolutionary coming. Personally I want to be surprised and amazed in 2014 - just like when the original iPhone was introduced back in 20007.\n",
