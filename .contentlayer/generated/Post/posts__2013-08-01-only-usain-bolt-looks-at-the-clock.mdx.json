It is _because he is really only competing against himself_.\n\nWhen trying to introduce innovation I often get asked a frustrating question. The question is \"Who else is doing/using this?\" or \"How does [_name any other company in your industry_] do it?\".\n\nIt seems in order to make a decision some people want to know what everyone else is doing first. This line of questioning is almost inevitable in a large organization but it makes me cringe when I hear it.\n\nThink about it for a moment. This isn't the recipe for leadership and innovation. This is the recipe for risk avoidance and going with the herd.
