The news institutions of the 20th century, print newspapers, the evening broadcast news, the trusted anchorman, are now relics of the past.\n\nWe turned to the Internet for news and information, eventually learning the hard way that we can’t trust the Internet. We no longer know what is real and what is fake. With everything now digital, and with excellent tools to edit audio, video, and photos, we have become skeptics. As soon as we see a viral video on YouTube we say to ourselves “that’s probably fake”. Every magazine with a beautiful girl on the cover we think to ourselves “Photoshop”. When we read a blog post we think “spin”.\n\nThe Internet is filled with anti-vaxxers, World Trade Center truthers, Kennedy theorists, religious fanatics of all stripes, and people who think that Barack Obama is a foreign-born Muslim. (He's not). Since we no longer trust what we read on the Internet we live in strange and interesting times. Now people are free to believe whatever they want to believe by discounting anything they see that does not align with their beliefs.\n\n> \"In the new media landscape, the wall between news and entertainment is crumbling.

How can we know what is real and true?\n\nI am not a fan of government oversight and regulation, but slowly I am starting to believe social media regulation is necessary. Regulation, combined with technology to rate the likelihood of image tampering, voice tampering, or a \"deep fake video\" plus information about the source of the content and some type of \"truth quotient\", or score, is needed. Since unregulated technology got us here, maybe regulated technology can restore balance. \n\nOtherwise, I am afraid our increasingly polarized country is going to continue down the path we are on - we are only fed the information we want to see, we have no way to judge the quality and accuracy of that information, and conflicting information is filtered from our view.\n\n### References\n\n- [Angela Merkel: internet search engines are 'distorting perception'](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/27/angela-merkel-internet-search-engines-are-distorting-our-perception)\n- [Facebook Top Source for Political News Among Millennials](http://www.journalism.org/2015/06/01/facebook-top-source-for-political-news-among-millennials/)\n- [How liars create the 'illusion of truth'](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20161026-how-liars-create-the-illusion-of-truth)\n- [Both Old and New Media Are Failing Voters](http://www.wsj.com/articles/both-old-and-new-media-are-failing-voters-1478216173)\n- [How the Internet Is Loosening Our Grip on the Truth](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/03/technology/how-the-internet-is-loosening-our-grip-on-the-truth.html)\n",
