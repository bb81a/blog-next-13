    "raw": "\nQuicken Loans and Warren Buffet announced a billion dollar prize for a perfect NCAA college bracket prediction. As Quicken Loans puts it:\n\n> You read that right: one billion. Not one million. Not one hundred million. Not five hundred million. One billion U.S. dollars.\n\n### Why Give Away a Billion Dollars?\n\nMy first reaction when I heard this is \"where is the value?\". Companies award prizes all time and we know the reason this occurs is basic economics - which teaches us that the \"cost\" of the prize is less than the \"value\" the company derives from offering the prize. So what amount marketing, exposure or publicity is worth **one billion dollars?**\n\nThe details of the prize are actually $25 million dollars for 40 years. So we can reframe the question as \"What amount of addional loan volume must Quicken Loans generate to produce more than $25 million of additional profit annually?\" To get there we need to know the average revenue per loan and Quicken's profit margin. For example if we assume $1,500 revenue per loan and a $10% profit margin this means Quicken Loans would earn a profit of $150 per loan. So $25,000,000 / $150 = 166,667 loans (rounding up).\n\n### This All May be Moot\n\nIt's virtually impossible to predict a perfect bracket. The math is simple: there are sixty-three games so it's 2 to the sixty-third power. The odds of you filling out a perfect bracket are a staggering 1 in 9.2 quintillion.\n\n#### How big is that?\n\n- That's one billion, 9.2 billion times.\n- It's 500,000 times more than our $17 trillion national debt.\n\n#### But I'm a Brackets Wizard!\n\nIf you are really smart and know that No. 1 seeds always advance in the first round, or tournament champions usually have a top-four seed, or about Duke's dual advantage of having a legend like Coach K and never getting called for a blocking foul you may be able to cut the odds down to something more like 1 in 128 billion.\n\nGet schooled by DePaul math professor Jay Bergen:\n\n<YouTube link='https://youtu.be/O6Smkv11Mj4' />\n\nUsing 1 in 128 billion odds, if everyone in the United States filled out a bracket, we'd see a perfect one **every 400 years**! ESPN which has run a tournament challenge for the past 16 years has **never had a perfect bracket in over 30 million entries** according to the network. I assume that many of the people filling those out are pretty smart.\n\n### True Genius!\n\nSo the true genius of this is the prize will almost certainly not be awarded thus the marketing, exposure and publicity is free! I initially puzzled over why Warren Buffet was involved but as a long time insurance executive he must have some sense of the actuarial odds on this. Brilliant!\n\n_Sources:_\n\n- [Quicken Loans](http://www.quickenloans.com/blog/quicken-loans-billion-dollar-bracket-challenge)\n",
