The idea behind the USDS is institutionalizing the approach that saved the US health care website.\n\nUSDS is launching with a pair of foundational texts: [A Digital Services Playbook](https://playbook.cio.gov/) with 13 key 'plays'\" for implementing digital government and a [TechFAR Handbook](https://github.com/WhiteHouse/playbook/blob/gh-pages/_includes/techfar-online.md) to advise agencies on how to take a more agile approach to federal contracting and procurement.\n\nAs I read through the digital playbook I was struck by the fact that it's full of common sense, elegantly designed, has clear navigation, and is responsive to any device you choose to view it upon. In other words it is nothing like any official government documentation I have ever seen before. Oh, and it's hosted on GitHub!\n\nThe playbook is basically applied common sense and smart best practices from silicon valley.
