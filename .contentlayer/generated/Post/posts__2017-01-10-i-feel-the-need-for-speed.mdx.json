I am definitely not a fan of that \"dark pattern\".\n\nUsually my go-to benchmark is the the venerable [Google PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/). PageSpeed Insights is very clear about delivering actionable steps you can take to improve overall speed and performance. Not too long ago Google also added a mobile section to give you insight about your mobile page performance as well.\n\nHowever I recently adopted Google's [Lighthouse](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse) tool and found that to be exceptionally useful, particularly since it is service worker aware.

In November 2014, Google started labeling sites as “mobile-friendly” to denote which pages are optimized for phones. In February 2015, Google announced plans to roll out mobile ranking changes on April 21 (an unprecedented move — the company almost never announces algorithm changes in advance).\n\nRecently (May 2016) Google announced it is rolling out an update to mobile search results that “increases the effect” of its mobile-friendly ranking signal. The goal is to “help our users find even more pages that are relevant and mobile-friendly,\".\n\nSo it is crystal clear that making your site mobile-friendly will help your rankings, but guess what? Making your site mobile-friendly makes it a **better experience for everyone, all the time**.\n\nWhy?\n\n- Performance benefits everyone. Don't waste the time of visitors to your site.\n- Responsiveness benefits everyone. I rarely if ever have the browser on my laptop at full screen.\n- Making your site handle network issues benefits everyone.\n\nIn other words making your site run well on a phone means it will run great on more capable hardware with more reliable networking and your page ranking will reflect it.\n\n#### References\n\n- [Lighthouse](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse)\n- [Google will start ranking ‘mobile-friendly’ sites even higher in May](http://venturebeat.com/2016/03/16/google-will-start-ranking-mobile-friendly-sites-even-higher-in-may/)\n- [PageSpeed](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/)\n",
