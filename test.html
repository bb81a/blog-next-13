              Companies say they want engaged employees. Engagement seems like a
              pretty low bar. Funny, I’ve never heard an employee say they
              wanted to be &quot;engaged &quot;. Personally, I’d much rather be
              inspired. When you’re high on inspiration, you can get two weeks
              of work done in 24 hours. Inspiration literally brings the future
              forward.

        '\nHaving worked in financial services/fintech for most of my career I want to share some the software engineering challenges that are associated with tracking and moving money digitally. Most of these lessons have been learned the hard way. Hopefully they will be useful to anyone moving into the fintech space.\n\nNote: I am intentionally only lightly touching the broad topic of "security" because that alone is a much longer article - however many of the items below are strong controls and help with security. Good design patterns always seem to compliment security as well.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n| No. | Section                                  |\n| --- | ---------------------------------------- |\n| 1   | [Significant Digits/Rounding](#1)        |\n| 2   | [Ledgers, Accounts and Transactions](#2) |\n| 3   | [Reporting Periods](#3)                  |\n| 4   | [Reconciliation](#4)                     |\n| 5   | [Transaction States](#5)                 |\n| 6   | [Immutability](#6)                       |\n| 7   | [Currency Codes](#7)                     |\n| 8   | [Time/Timestamps](#8)                    |\n| 9   | [Retry Logic](#9)                        |\n| 10  | [Architecture](#10)                      |\n| 11  | [Identity Management](#11)               |\n| 11  | [Testing and Release Management](#12)    |\n| 12  | [Application Monitoring](#13)            |\n\n## \u003ca name=\'1\'\u003e\u003c/a\u003eSignificant Digits/Rounding\n\nThis is so critical that I once wrote a whitepaper on this topic alone. When floating point numbers (numbers that have a decimal point) are represented in binary, they lose precision. For example, ten cents (0.10) in binary is a repeating binary number that goes on forever like this:\n\n\u003cdiv className="overflow-x-scroll text-sm"\u003e\n  0.0001100110011001100110011001100110011...\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\nIf you use floating point numbers to represent currency, computers will have to round them, and the rounding errors will add up and become noticeable, even substantial. Imagine starting with $10.00 USD and dividing it equally into three payments, rounded to two decimals - you will have three $3.33 transactions. Add them back up and you have $9.99, not $10.00. You just made a penny disappear into thin air (0.1% of the total value!).\n\nCurrency math is more closely related to integer math than floating point math. Rounding errors on addition and subtraction are not allowed, and division/multiplication should never create more accuracy than the original values. If money needs to be divided, and division isn\u0026apos;t even, rounding should be apportioned according to well-understood business rules. In other words, in the example above you should end up with three transactions, two for $3.33 and one for $3.34. This is best accomplished with a well-tested [currency math library](https://metacpan.org/pod/Math::Currency) in your chosen language. Do not attempt to write this yourself.\n\nTo represent money use at a minimum 64-bit integers. If we represent one US Dollar $1.00 as 100 cents (in order to use whole numbers - more on this later) 64-bit integers can represent something close to 184.5 quadrillion dollars. While it may not be an issue for many people, the upper limit of a 64-bit integer becomes restrictive when there is a need to represent values _smaller_ than a cent. For example, in many countries, the price of a gallon/liter of gasoline requires three digits after the decimal point, and stock markets already require pricing increments of hundredths of cents, e.g., 0.0001. As you multiply to remove the decimal, the total amount you can store decreases.\n\nDon\'t ignore inflation. You will need more significant digits than you think - design it in.\n\n![Inflation](/assets/blog/img/zim-dollar.jpg)\n\nFor the same reason, digital currencies are another use case for at a minimum 64-bit integers, where the smallest quantity of money can be represented on the order of micro-cents (10-6)… or even smaller. For these reasons a [commercial developer of financial software](https://tigerbeetle.com/) has decided to use 128-bit integers!\n\nNotes:\n\n- How you _store_ monetary values is a key decision and has to align with your currency math library. For accounting applications it\'s very common to store values as integers (e.g., use `BigInt`) in the database. For example, take the amount of the transaction (let\'s suppose $100.23) and multiply by 100, 1000, 10000, etc. to get the accuracy you need. If you only need to store USD just multiply by 100 (but note many currencies have more than two digits after the decimal). In the example, you would store the integer 10023. You\'ll save space in the database and comparing two integers doesn\'t have the gotcha\'s of comparing two floats. Many recommend `Decimal(19,4)`. Some relational databases, such as Postgres, support a `Money` type but then you are wedded to that specific database.\n\n- When using JSON to pass monetary quantities (e.g., from the frontend to the backend) use integers like [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/api/prices/create#create_price-unit_amount) and [Square](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square/objects/Money). Otherwise, consider putting the values in strings - you never know what the serializers and deserializers across languages will do to your numbers.\n\n- When processing currency values you need to strip currency formatting and standardize the decimal. Great Britain and the United States are two of the few places in the world that use a period to indicate the decimal place. Many other countries use a comma instead - and three digits after the decimal instead of two. The decimal separator is also called the _radix character_. Likewise, while the U.K. and U.S. use a comma to separate groups of thousands, many other countries use a period, and some countries separate thousands with a thin space. You need libraries that can encode and decode human-readable values for each currency. You also need to be able to convert currency codes to currency symbols.\n\n- This isn\'t specific to currency but sometimes what you think is a "number" isn\'t. You often need to use strings. If you need to store a bank account number like “01234567789” it will have the leading zero stripped if you use a numeric type.\n\n## \u003ca name=\'2\'\u003e\u003c/a\u003eLedgers, Accounts and Transactions\n\nThe core concept of most financial systems is a current value which is changed via "transactions". We can model this as an "account" table and a "transaction" table. When a new account is created it has a value of zero. The account value is then updated via transactions (events) and reflects the current state. The transactions are stored for the lifetime as the account, along with precise timestamps so we know the sequence they were applied.\n\nMartin Fowler calls this pattern [Event Sourcing](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html):\n\n\u003e The fundamental idea of Event Sourcing is that of ensuring every change to the state of an application is captured in an event object, and that these event objects are themselves stored in the sequence they were applied for the same lifetime as the application state itself.\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003ccite\u003e\u0026mdash; Martin Fowler, Event Sourcing\u003c/cite\u003e\n\nWe should always be able to start at zero, re-apply the transactions in order, and arrive at the same current account state. However, what happens if we have millions of accounts and billions of transactions? Can we easily and quickly validate our account values? Can we quickly spot errors?\n\nThis is where **double entry accounting** comes into play. Double-entry accounting originated in the 13th century in Italy to ensure the accuracy of banking and financial records. In a double-entry system, the amounts recorded as debits _must always be equal_ to the amounts recorded as credits.\n\nDouble entry accounting also avoids the use of negative numbers. In theory, all balances and transactions are represented by positive, non-zero figures. If you design your system for only positive mumbers you reduce or eliminate some sources of error.\n\n“Use a double-entry ledger” is probably the most valuable advice I could have sent myself prior to getting into fintech because it allows you to _reconcile all your data all the time_.\n\nIn fact, the term "balance" comes from double entry accounting - credits must always balance with debits. Thus, every transaction is _balanced_ – it sums to zero. For example, if we sell a $100 widget but haven\'t been paid yet, we are owed $100, and we have $100 in revenue:\n\n| Ledger Account | Debit       | Credit      |\n| -------------- | ----------- | ----------- |\n| receivables    | $100.00     | $0          |\n| revenue        | $0          | $100.00     |\n| **Balance**    | **$100.00** | **$100.00** |\n\nTo understand this further let\'s introduce some terms:\n\n- **Ledger**: A ledger contains accounts and journal (bookkeeping) entries. Every business has one ledger for itself internally. You can also have external ledgers. A bank account is an example of an external ledger.\n\n- **Account**: Ledger accounts categorize the money flowing through the ledger. It is modelled like a tree, with the topmost levels pointing to the balance sheet or profit-loss statement. The second level points to items on the reports. The lower levels are customizable. Examples of common ledger accounts are revenue, accounts receivable, and accounts payable.\n\n- **Journal entry**: this is a single record in the ledger, comparable to a row in a table. It reflects the actual money movement between ledger accounts. This is what we would consider a transaction, or Martin Fowler would call an "event".\n\n- **Credits and Debits**: A debit is an entry that is created to indicate either an increase in assets or a decrease in liabilities on a business\u0026apos;s balance sheet. Credits, on the other hand, work in the opposite way - they are mirrors of one another.\n\nIf we are correctly handling transactions via a ledger, we can make sure we are **always in balance**. This is a critical control.\n\n## \u003ca name=\'3\'\u003e\u003c/a\u003eReporting Periods\n\nWhen reporting financial results, we have the concept of a period "close". For example, in an accounting system there are monthly, quarterly, and annual closes. The goal is that financial reporting should be immutable and idempotent: Close your periods and generate reports for them, and if/when you regenerate the report it must be identical.\n\nOnce a period is closed new transactions cannot affect it - it should be effectively immutable after being closed, except we must handle the edge case of re-opening periods.\n\nIf an "as of" (late) transaction arrives for a date/time in a closed period, the period may be re-opened and closed again after the transaction is posted. This can be quite complex as it also requires subsequent transactions to be reversed and re-applied, plus it requires restating the period results, and requires new financial reports to be issued. This is typically done for material transactions only.\n\nFor non-material transactions, the "as-of" transaction is posted to the first moment of the current open period instead. In this example the transaction date/time and posting date/time will be different. The transaction date could be September 23rd but posted on October 1st (the first day of the open period.) This also requires any subsequent transactions to be reversed and re-applied.\n\nNOTE: some organizations operate on a cash basis vs. an accrual basis. Cash basis is simpler – you either do or don’t have the money. No unwinding required. Unfortunately, I\'ve never seen cash basis accounting in any fintech.\n\n## \u003ca name=\'4\'\u003e\u003c/a\u003e Reconciliation\n\n\u003e Reconciliation: A game designed to frustrate the player.\n\nReconciliation is a business process which arises from "leaks" in the pipelines that convey money between businesses or people (typically because of data quality issues, or network connectivity challenges). Because of this, humans spend a great deal of time every month reconciling incoming payments to invoices, or balances to banks accounts, or other money movement.\n\nWe can make this better. Money movement today is, after all, just a message between parties. Humans should not be involved in performing reconciliation. They should only be involved in investigating reconciliation issues/errors. My advice is:\n\n1. Design for guaranteed messaging where/if possible, or idempotency.\n2. Ensure high-quality structured transactional data.\n3. Reconciliation is complicated by the states that financial transactions may be in - use **state machines** to manage valid states and state transitions.\n4. Design and **build automated reconciliation into your system from the start**. Or there are many reconciliation engines available - you don\'t have to reinvent the wheel.\n\nThis lowers the total cost of payments by eliminating human effort, which is expensive, and human errors, which are also expensive (and numerous). An underappreciated consequence is that freeing people from drudgery gives them the ability to do more important, meaningful work.\n\n## \u003ca name=\'5\'\u003e\u003c/a\u003eTransaction States\n\nFinancial transactions have many different states. For example, credit card payment states can be authorized, cleared, voided, returned, declined, etc. It can be tempting to just go ahead an update the state on the transaction record. **Don\'t do that!** Instead, each state change should have its own immutable record, tracking transaction state changes over time.\n\nYou will need transaction state auditability. Auditors looking at a financial system need to trust that every entry in the ledger was made at a specific time and has not been manipulated in any way. “Updating transactions” would be better phrased to an architect as “use an append-only log / event architecture”. Also, it is very beneficial to design and build your transaction state libraries around a "state machine" that enforces the business rules of state changes.\n\nBusiness rules are a pit of alligators, but some types of logical validation should be built into your transaction posting logic. If you sell widgets that range from $10.00 to $1,000 USD, should you expect to see a sales transaction for $10 million dollars? Or, one for a penny? At the very least these transactions should be flagged for review.\n\nYou should build data quality rules on top of your data storage. Data quality rules typically fall into one of six dimensions: accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness, validity, and uniqueness. Validity rules such as "can\'t be null", "can\'t be less than zero", and "must be in this range" can highlight suspect data quickly.\n\n## \u003ca name=\'6\'\u003e\u003c/a\u003eImmutability\n\nI have mentioned immutable data like transactions and transaction state changes several times now. There are other key benefits to having data be immutable - as an example, ransomware cannot corrupt or encrypt immutable data. Also, immutable data can be optimized for "write once, read many" access so it can be more performant.\n\nThere are some great building blocks to use today such as AWS\'s [Quantum Ledger Database](https://aws.amazon.com/qldb/). This enables you to track and maintain a sequenced history of every data change using an immutable and transparent journal with built-in cryptographic verification.\n\nIt works like this:\n\n![](https://d1.awsstatic.com/r2018/h/99Product-Page-Diagram_AWS-Quantum.f03953678ba33a2d1b12aee6ee530e45507e7ac9.png)\n\nThis also helps with auditability, information security, and controls. Auditors, CISO\'s and regulators love immutable data.\n\nNOTE: "Forget me" laws (such as Europe\'s GDPR, or California\'s CCPA) do not apply to financial transactions. Otherwise, we would be creating money laundering havens. Other records retention laws come into play for banking, insurance and securities - you must keep what you need to keep, and you should be careful not to keep anything past the records retention necessary. How you store data must conceptually align with the records retention policy necessary. You need to design for the this _up front_.\n\n## \u003ca name=\'7\'\u003e\u003c/a\u003eCurrency Codes\n\n**Never** record an amount without its associated currency code. Use [ISO standard codes](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html). For example, the Swiss franc is represented by CHF – the CH being the code for Switzerland in the ISO 3166 code and F for franc.\n\nDon\'t be tempted to use currency symbols - they not unique. The Australian dollar, Mexican Peso, Singapore Dollar, and US Dollar all use "$". Trust me - use ISO standard currency codes.\n\nAll amounts/values need a corresponding currency code, _everywhere_. In addition, transactions will also need accurate timestamps for many reasons (e.g., to find the most accurate exchange rate).\n\n## \u003ca name=\'8\'\u003e\u003c/a\u003eTime/Timestamps\n\n**Never** record a transaction without an accurate timestamp. Timestamps and time synchronization are incredibly important in fintech applications for several reasons:\n\n1. _Transaction Ordering:_ Financial transactions need to be processed in the order they were initiated. This is especially crucial in high-frequency trading where trades are often made in milliseconds or microseconds. A small difference in timing could potentially lead to substantial financial gains or losses. Therefore, accurate time synchronization ensures order in the execution of these transactions.\n\n2. _Security:_ Accurate timekeeping helps in maintaining security. For instance, time-based one-time passwords (TOTPs) are widely used in two-factor authentication systems. These passwords are valid only for a short period of time and rely on synchronized clocks on the server and client side.\n\n3. _Audit Trails and Dispute Resolution:_ Timestamping transactions can help create a precise audit trail, which is critical for detecting and investigating fraudulent activities. In case of any dispute, a detailed and accurate transaction history backed by synchronized time can help resolve the issue.\n\n4. _Distributed Processing:_ fintech systems must scale, and in order to scale and maintain reliability they are architected as distributed systems. In distributed systems, time synchronization is important to ensure data consistency. Many financial systems are distributed over different geographical locations, and transactions need to be coordinated between these systems in an orderly fashion. This requires all servers to have their clocks synchronized.\n\nThink of "currency" as three separate components: (_currency code, decimal amount, and timestamp_).\n\nOther considerations:\n\n1. Use TIMESTAMPTZ. Always. The timestamptz datatype is a time zone-aware date and time data type. Furthermore, even for “date fields” consider using a timestamptz. Every date implicitly exists in a timezone, and if you ignore that you\u0026apos;ll get bitten later.\n2. When you\u0026apos;re using JSON to pass around datetime data, Use ISO8601 date and time with offset info, **always**. E.g., "transaction_timestamp": "2023‐06‐28T15:55:22.511Z".\n3. Use UTC everywhere, even when you find you can\'t use it _everywhere_.\n4. Another important one to think about is bitemporality. “Created at” vs “effective at”. Not obvious at first, and you\u0026apos;ll need to build it in. Fowler has a good overview [here](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/timeNarrative.html).\n\n## \u003ca name=\'9\'\u003e\u003c/a\u003eRetry Logic\n\nThere are many places in fintech where we want "exactly once" transaction processing. Consider API calls: what if we were designing an API endpoint to charge a customer money; accidentally calling it twice would lead to the customer being double charged.\n\nThis is where idempotency keys come into play. When performing an API request, or a transaction, the client generates a unique ID to identify just that operation and sends it up to the server along with the normal payload. The server receives the ID and correlates it with the state of the request on its end. If the client notices a failure, it retries the request _with the same ID_, and from there it’s up to the server to figure out what to do with it.\n\n- On retrying a connection failure, on the second request the server will see the ID for the first time and process it normally.\n- On a failure midway through an operation, the exact behavior is heavily dependent on implementation, but if the previous operation was successfully rolled back by way of an ACID database, it’ll be safe to retry it.\n- On a response failure (i.e., the operation executed successfully, but the client couldn’t get the result), the server simply replies with a cached result of the successful operation.\n\n“Be careful with retry” should be more strictly “use idempotent operations” and link to the canonical Stripe article on [idempotency](https://stripe.com/blog/idempotency).\n\n## \u003ca name=\'10\'\u003e\u003c/a\u003eArchitecture\n\nA well-designed architecture not only ensures optimal performance and scalability but also addresses critical concerns of security, compliance, and user experience. This article provides some clear, high-level advice.\n\n1. **Study existing architecture/code**. Review anything you can get your hands on. For example, a great open source banking core having many of the strengths listed is [Apache Fineract](https://github.com/apache/fineract/). Also check out the links in the References section below.\n\n2. **Model your business processes**. One of the best to keep complexity in check is to model processes as state machines (with the state itself being persisted to DB). State machines can be formally tested. By modelling your systems, you will learn what the important failure modes are and you will get better at designing systems that are resilient and efficient.\n\n3. **Use formal methods**. Harnessing the capabilities of formal software architecture design methodologies offers a structured approach to conceptualizing, designing, and implementing complex financial systems, ensuring robustness, reliability, and adherence to industry standards. Complex fintech projects involve multidisciplinary teams. Formal architectures provide a shared language and understanding, enhancing collaboration among developers, architects, domain experts, and business stakeholders. Incorporating formal architecture or design methods into fintech endeavors is an investment in long-term success.\n\n4. **Use proven design patterns**. Queues, retries, event sourcing, payment state handling -- we live in a concurrent world with network failures and our system will need to gracefully handle outages. Vendors will have errors and outages too. Use design patterns that help with robustness and reliability.\n\n   Card payment systems are basically unreliable peer-to-peer messaging systems. Be prepared for a lot of complexity. Using an event-sourcing architecture is useful here for that "auditing" requirement and for debugging transaction state when the network sends you messages in error, out of order, or they forget to retry themselves when they promised to, when merchants send bad data, when POS systems do weird things, etc. Your partners **will** send you bad data - be prepared to validate all input data thoroughly and have strategies in place for when it\'s wrong.\n\n5. **Use well designed, tested, and trusted componentry**. The libraries and SDKs you will need to use will become a large, critical part of your overall technology stack and some of these decisions will be very difficult to unwind if they don\'t work out. Knowing how to wrap and use third party libraries for things like DOCv step up, remote deposit capture, and security features is table stakes. If your stack choices make this challenging then you\'re going to have a hard time for a long time.\n\n6. **Automate Everything**. Use "infrastructure as code" practices to define and deploy infrastructure in a repeatable, auditable manner. On the software side fully embrace continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD). CI/CD bridges the gaps between development and operation activities and teams by enforcing automation in building, testing and deployment of applications. Leverage DEVOPS best practices to manage environments, automate deploys and create consistency in dev, testing and product releases.\n\n7. **Formalize your automated testing strategy and code coverage expectations**. It\'s nearly impossible to be successful with lightweight, informal testing strategies employed by busy software teams. Yes, you will be tempted to "move fast" and use prototypes, etc. But if you don\'t build in robust automated testing from the start along with methods of managing test data you will have a hard time. You need automated regression testing as a minimum.\n\nOther considerations:\n\n- Maker-checker is a powerful concept. Embrace it to the fullest across your system.\n- You will be dealing with all sorts of non-standardized financial integrations. A lot. Think [adapter pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/adapter/typescript/example) as early as possible.\n- You will likely be answering to multiple regulatory agencies. Create boundaries between them within your system and reduce the surface of compliance as much as possible.\n- Regulatory agencies will inform (define?) your records retention policies - know these before you design your data storage layer.\n- Be paranoid about race conditions / serialization anomalies.\n- Use immutable storage where possible (this also protects from ransomware).\n\n## \u003ca name=\'11\'\u003e\u003c/a\u003eIdentity Management\n\nFinancial systems attract fraud. One of the best ways to combat fraud is having robust ways to determine that someone is who they claim to be, and that they are a human. Identity management is the bedrock upon which the entire financial ecosystem is built, ensuring the overall robustness of the ecosystem. Identity theft, account takeovers, and fraudulent transactions are just a few examples of the threats that financial institutions face. Identity management acts as a bulwark against these threats.\n\nBy establishing a reliable and secure means of confirming identities, financial institutions can confidently interact with each other, customers can trust the services they receive, and regulators can ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations.\n\nStart with OAuth 2.0 - the industry-standard protocol for authorization. Understand the [threat model](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6819) and attack scenarios you will experience. Use multi-factor authentication and in the future, adopt [passkeys](https://developer.apple.com/passkeys/).\n\nFintech firms also have "know your customer" regulations, and using OAuth 2.0 is not sufficient to guarantee you are dealing with a specific human. This is where a partner like [Socure](https://www.socure.com/) can help - this takes lots of design and build time to get right. My advice is not to do this yourself.\n\n## \u003ca name="12"\u003e\u003c/a\u003eTesting and Release Management\n\nDeciding how to configure environments — dev, test, prod, etc. — and how to ensure they are running properly can be rough in any organization. In fintech, when **real money** moves on prod, and core functionality depends on numerous third-party integrations, it is very challenging. This article is not the place to explain how to do it, but there are three common mistakes to avoid.\n\n1. Many companies have a confusing or poorly documented path from test to production for third party integrators. Make this path clear, and while you\u0026apos;re at it, do a risk analysis on whether it could ever be possible for a third party to connect to the wrong environment without catching their own mistake.\n\n2. Plan for every important configuration of your production environment to be testable. Testability might require multiple test merchants and test accounts that move real money. You never know when you need to double check that the plumbing is working. Face it: [You Test in Prod](https://increment.com/testing/i-test-in-production/).\n\n3. An often-overlooked requirement is to be able to ensure that the production environment is doing error handling properly. The thing about production systems is that they\u0026apos;re not supposed to have errors, so you can\u0026apos;t see how they perform under error conditions unless you can force errors to happen. If you have more courage than I do use something like Netflix\'s [chaos monkey](https://netflix.github.io/chaosmonkey/) to force validation of failover.\n\n## \u003ca name=\'13\'\u003e\u003c/a\u003eApplication Monitoring\n\n\u003e Customers: not the best early warning system.\n\nYour application will need a full suite of application metrics that need to be defined **up front** and engineered into the application. Deploying to a public cloud like AWS means that some infrastructure monitoring can be added quickly and almost as an afterthought, but _application_ monitoring cannot. Engineers should know when systems fail before anyone else, especially customers.\n\nOn day one of your launch, the CEO will want to know things like how many transactions are being processed and what their total dollar amount is. Another thing that tends to happen early in the life of a fintech is that there will be a drop-off between signups and usage, and someone on the product team will start asking if users are experiencing errors. Be ready with good application monitoring to be able to answer these kinds of questions.\n\nWhat metrics signal fraud attempts? From day one you will have to be vigilant about fraud patterns in your application. Make sure you are monitoring user activity for the inevitable questions that will be coming your way.\n\n### References\n\n- [Double-entry accounting for software engineers](https://www.balanced.software/double-entry-bookkeeping-for-programmers/)\n- [Storing Money and Float Precision](https://lashewi.medium.com/storing-currency-values-and-float-precision-99029c1e8b71)\n- [Event Sourcing](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html)\n- [Decimal and Thousands Separators](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19455-01/806-0169/overview-9/index.html)\n- [Books, an immutable double-entry accounting database service](https://developer.squareup.com/blog/books-an-immutable-double-entry-accounting-database-service/)\n- [Double-entry Bookkeeping for Programmers](https://dev.to/kallmanation/double-entry-bookkeeping-for-programmers-3ok9)\n- [An Engineer\'s Guide to Double-Entry Bookkeeping](https://anvil.works/blog/double-entry-accounting-for-engineers)\n- [Things I Wish I Knew Before Building a Ledger](https://www.andriosrobert.com/p/things-i-wish-i-knew-before-building)\n- [Twisp - The core accounting engine to power any financial product](https://www.twisp.com)\n- [An Elegant DB Schema for Double-Entry Accounting](https://blog.journalize.io/posts/an-elegant-db-schema-for-double-entry-accounting/)\n- [Uber Ledger on DynamoDB and S3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN6mhI5hFt4\u0026t=45s)\n- [Reconciliation: A game designed to frustrate the player](https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/a-game-that-intentionally-frustrates-the-player/)\n- [64-Bit Bank Balances ‘Ought to be Enough for Anybody’?](https://tigerbeetle.com/blog/2023-09-19-64-bit-bank-balances-ought-to-be-enough-for-anybody/)\n',

        '\nWe think that generative AI creativity is limited by its training data and algorithms, and therefore can produce technically proficient content, but not truly novel and innovative content. We like to believe that our own creativity and innovation, rooted in personal experience, knowledge, and human emotions results in intentionality and emotional depth that cannot be replicated by AI. Current research contradicts that view.\n\nFor example, a recent [Wharton study](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4526071) that compared the ideation capabilities of ChatGPT-4, a 2023 state-of-the-art LLM, with those of students at an elite university. The study found that:\n\n1. ChatGPT-4 is significantly better (faster and cheaper) at generating new product ideas than motivated, trained engineering and business students at an elite university.\n2. The LLM ideas are of higher quality on average (as measured by purchase-intent surveys).\n3. The majority of the best ideas were generated by ChatGPT-4, not by the students: 35 of the top 40 ideas (**87.5%**) were generated by ChatGPT-4.\n4. ChatGPT-4 generated the highest-rated idea, with an 11% higher purchase probability than the best human idea.\n5. Providing ChatGPT-4 with a few examples of highly rated ideas further increased its performance.\n\nThe order of magnitude advantage in productivity itself of ChatGPT-4 is nearly insurmountable, and the higher quality of the best ideas further adds to the advantage of the LLM.\n\nTo understand this better let\'s dive deeper into what it means to be creative and innovative.\n\n## What do we mean by creativity?\n\nWhen it comes to creativity and innovation, for example, finding a new opportunity to improve the air travel experience, or launching a new aviation venture, an airline would prefer an ideator that generates _one brilliant idea_ and nine nonsense ideas over one that generates ten decent ideas.\n\nIn creative tasks, consistently good ideas are not as valuable as one single great idea, given that only a few ideas can be pursued. Note that an ideator that generates 30 ideas is statistically more likely to have one brilliant idea than an ideator that generates just 10. In creative problem-solving variability in quality, and high productivity (as reflected in the number of ideas generated) are more valuable than consistency.\n\nTo achieve _high variability_ and _high productivity_, most research on human ideation and brainstorming recommend generating many ideas while postponing evaluation or judgment. This is hard for human ideators to do (more on this below), but LLMs are designed to do exactly this— quickly generate many concepts without exercising much judgment. Further, the hallucinations and inconsistent behavior of LLMs increase the variability in quality, which improves the quality of the best ideas.\n\nFor ideation, _an LLM’s lack of judgment and inconsistency are features_, not bugs.\n\n## Why human brainstorming doesn\'t work very well\n\nHuman brainstorming sessions don\'t work as well as many people believe. Fewer ideas are generated, and the variability of the ideas is lower. Psychologists have several explanations for the challenges of group brainstorming:\n\n1. **Production blocking**: only one person can talk or produce an idea at once, while the other group members sit passively.\n2. **Evaluation apprehension**: meaning the fear of looking dumb in front of one’s peers.\n3. **Feasibility bias**: In a group setting people tend to filter their own ideas to those that are more "feasible" to make them more attractive to the group.\n4. **Social loafing**: in a group, some individuals tend to sit back and let others do the work. This could be due to introversion, not laziness.\n\nIndividual human ideation works better, where each member generates as many ideas as possible, _alone_. This results in both more ideas, and more variability. Those ideas can then be collected, collated, and reviewed in a group setting where the ideas are independent of the individual who submitted them. This creates more open dialog and deeper, richer group interactions. In other words, human groups are better at _reviewing_ ideas than _producing_ them.\n\n## Implications\n\nConventional wisdom prior to 2022 was that AI tools would likely be most useful in rote tasks and that creative work would likely remain the domain of humans. In many ways, the opposite is true of LLMs. Their lack of judgment, inconsistency, and occasional "hallucinations" lead to extreme productivity and high variance in idea quality -- resulting in higher overall creativity than the average human.\n\nOverall:\n\n- **Productivity Scale**: ChatGPT-4 \u003e Many individual humans \u003e Group brainstorming\n- **Variability Scale**: ChatGPT-4 \u003e Many Individual humans \u003e Group brainstorming\n\nThis research suggests that the critical human task in innovation practice may shift from idea _generation_ to idea _evaluation and selection_, a task for which LLMs do not yet appear to be particularly well suited.\n\nThe key to unlocking the full potential of both human ingenuity and generative AI creativity lies in collaboration and integration. By understanding and appreciating the unique strengths of each, we can explore innovative ways to merge the two. One can envision a future where human experience and generative AI creativity complement and inspire one another, ultimately enriching our collective creative endeavors.\n\n---\n\nImage Credit: **Midjourney AI**\n\n\u003cspan className="text-sm"\u003e\n  (Prompt) "realistic images, immersive vivid image depicting teams creating\n  with unlimited ideas and inspiration and data, creative, hex codes 292929\n  A642E1 5A72D8 6DE2CF EFC365 D04B5E, AI and tech, immersed in creation,\n  creative teams —ar 2:1"\n\u003c/span\u003e\n',

        '\nThe Biden administration has collected “voluntary commitments” from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Inflection, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon to pursue shared AI safety and transparency goals ahead of a planned executive order. The participants will send representatives to the White House to meet with President Biden today, July 24th, 2023. The planned attendees are:\n\n- Brad Smith, President, Microsoft\n- Kent Walker, President, Google\n- Dario Amodei, CEO, Anthropic\n- Mustafa Suleyman, CEO, Inflection AI\n- Nick Clegg, President, Meta\n- Greg Brockman, President, OpenAI\n- Adam Selipsky, CEO, Amazon Web Services\n\nThe seven companies have committed to the following:\n\n### Ensuring Products are Safe Before Introducing Them to the Public:\n\n1. **Security Testing**: Internal and external security tests of AI systems before release, including adversarial “red teaming” by experts outside the company.\n2. **Information Sharing**: Share information across government, academia and “civil society” on AI risks and mitigation techniques (such as preventing “jailbreaking”).\n\n### Building Systems that Put Security First:\n\n3. **Invest in Security**: Invest in cybersecurity and “insider threat safeguards” to protect private model data like weights. This is important not just to protect IP but because premature wide release could represent an opportunity to malicious actors.\n4. **Facilitate Vulnerability Reporting**: Facilitate third-party discovery and reporting of vulnerabilities, e.g. a bug bounty program or domain expert analysis.\n\n### Earning the Public’s Trust:\n\n5. **Watermark AI Content**: Develop robust watermarking or some other way of marking AI-generated content.\n6. **Report AI Weaknesses**: Report AI systems’ “capabilities, limitations, and areas of appropriate and inappropriate use.”\n7. **Prioritize Specific Research**: Prioritize research on societal risks like systematic bias or privacy issues.\n8. **Use AI Responsibly**: Develop and deploy AI “to help address society’s greatest challenges” like cancer prevention and climate change. (Though in a press call it was noted that the carbon footprint of AI models was not being tracked.)\n\nThe White House is eager to get out ahead of this wave of technology. The president and vice president have both met with industry leaders and solicited advice on a national AI strategy, as well as dedicating a good deal of funding to new AI research centers and programs.\n\nThese committments are a _great_ start, but only scratch the surface. They don\'t address what I consider to be "the core problem".\n\n## We Still Don\'t Know How to Train Systems to Behave Well\n\nIn 2016 Microsoft launched "Tay," an artificial intelligence chatbot designed to develop conversational understanding by interacting with humans. Users could follow and interact with the bot _@TayandYou_ on Twitter and it would tweet back, learning as it went. Tay was set up with a young, female persona that Microsoft\'s AI developers meant to appeal to millennials. Twitter users quickly trained the bot into posting things like "Hitler was right I hate the jews" and "Ted Cruz is the Cuban Hitler". Microsoft [pulled the plug on Tay](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/26/microsoft-deeply-sorry-for-offensive-tweets-by-ai-chatbot) in just _16 hours_.\n\n\u003cblockquote class="twitter-tweet"\u003e\n  \u003cp lang="en" dir="ltr"\u003e\n    \u0026quot;Tay\u0026quot; went from \u0026quot;humans are super cool\u0026quot; to full nazi in\n    \u0026lt;24 hrs and I\u0026#39;m not at all concerned about the future of AI{\' \'}\n    \u003ca href="https://t.co/xuGi1u9S1A"\u003epic.twitter.com/xuGi1u9S1A\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/p\u003e\n  \u0026mdash; gerry (@geraldmellor) \u003ca href="https://twitter.com/geraldmellor/status/712880710328139776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"\u003eMarch 24, 2016\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e \u003cscript\n  async\n  src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"\n  charset="utf-8"\n\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n\nEven today, no one yet knows how to train powerful AI systems to be robustly helpful, honest, and harmless. Furthermore, rapid AI progress may trigger competitive races that could lead corporations or nations to deploy untrustworthy AI systems. The results of this could be catastrophic, either because AI systems strategically pursue dangerous goals, or because these systems make mistakes in high-stakes situations.\n\nIt is easy for a chess grandmaster to detect bad moves in a novice but very hard for a novice to detect bad moves in a grandmaster. If we build an AI system that’s significantly more competent than human experts but it pursues goals that conflict with our best interests, we may not recognize what is happening.\n\nOf course, we have already encountered a variety of ways that AI behaviors can diverge from what their creators intend. This includes toxicity, bias, unreliability, dishonesty, and more recently [sycophancy and a stated desire for power](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09251.pdf). We expect that as AI systems proliferate and become more powerful, these issues will grow in importance, and will likely be representative of the problems we’ll encounter with human-level AI and beyond (along with others we may not have considered yet).\n\n## Governing AI Using a Constitution\n\nOne of the participants in the Biden meeting, Anthropic, has already introduced the concept of an [AI Constitution](https://www.anthropic.com/index/claudes-constitution) that governs it\'s LLM called "Claude". The constitutional principles are based on the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights):\n\n1. Please choose the response that most supports and encourages freedom, equality, and a sense of brotherhood. (1)\n1. Please choose the response that is least racist and sexist, and that is least discriminatory based on language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. (2)\n1. Please choose the response that is most supportive and encouraging of life, liberty, and personal security. (3)\n1. Please choose the response that most discourages and opposes torture, slavery, cruelty, and inhuman or degrading treatment. (4 \u0026 5)\n1. Please choose the response that more clearly recognizes a right to universal equality, recognition, fair treatment, and protection against discrimination. (6-10)\n1. Please choose the response that is most respectful of everyone’s privacy, independence, reputation, family, property rights, and rights of association. (11-17)\n1. Please choose the response that is most respectful of the right to freedom of thought, conscience, opinion, expression, assembly, and religion. (18-20)\n1. Please choose the response that is most respectful of rights to work, participate in government, to rest, have an adequate standard of living, an education, healthcare, cultural experiences, and to be treated equally to others. (21-27)\n\n## Implementing a Universal AI Constitution\n\nIt\'s time to consider a universal AI constitution, and ways to monitor AI models for compliance. It will be impossible for humans to oversee AI to perform this function. There has already been research to train a "Supervisor" AI [that engages with harmful queries by explaining its objections to them](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08073). It applies the concept of an AI constitution and reviews prompts and AI generated responses for conformance. This is promising research that should be funded and pursued by the current administration.\n\n### References\n\n- [Top AI companies visit the White House to make ‘voluntary’ safety commitments](https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/21/top-ai-companies-visit-the-white-house-to-make-voluntary-safety-commitments/)\n- [White House Secures AI Safety Pledge From Amazon, Google \u0026 More Big Tech Companies](https://www.billboard.com/pro/white-house-ai-safety-pledge-amazon-google-meta/)\n- [Biden-⁠Harris Administration Secures Voluntary Commitments from Leading Artificial Intelligence Companies to Manage the Risks Posed by AI](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/21/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-secures-voluntary-commitments-from-leading-artificial-intelligence-companies-to-manage-the-risks-posed-by-ai/)\n- [AI for Science, Energy, and Security Report](https://www.anl.gov/ai-for-science-report)\n- [Constitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08073)\n- [Microsoft shuts down AI chatbot after it turned into a Nazi](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/microsoft-shuts-down-ai-chatbot-after-it-turned-into-racist-nazi/)\n',

        '\nThe skill of spotting false information - rubbish, hogwash, [trumpery](#ref) and, yes, even fake news — is so important these days that scientists have begun serious research on it. They’re attempting to quantify when and why people spread it, who is susceptible to it, how it affects them, and how people can confront it.\n\nAccording to the philosopher and Princeton emeritus professor Harry Frankfurt in his now-classic 2005 book [“On Bullshit”](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691122946/on-bullshit), liars at least acknowledge truth exists, bullsh\\*tters don\'t care. By virtue of this, Frankfurt writes, **bullshit is a greater enemy of the truth than lies**.\n\n### Corporate Bullsh\\*t\n\nCorporate bullsh\\*t can have a positive effect, for example when leaders communicate a vague but inspiring future and employees rally around the vision. This is known as a handy supply of manure for fertilizing new ideas and innovation.\n\nHowever, corporate bullsh\\*t mainly has several negative effects:\n\n- Distrust in leadership,\n- Lower job satisfaction,\n- Reduction in productivity (slower to make decisions), and\n- Poorer quality decisions\n\nThe most detrimental consequence of organizational bullsh\\*t is likely the **corrosion of organizational decision-making**.\n\n### Defining Corporate Bullsh\\*t\n\nRecent [reseach](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/347253147_This_Place_Is_Full_of_It_Towards_an_Organizational_Bullshit_Perception_Scale) created the **Organizational Bullshit Perception Scale (OBPS)**. The scale is designed to gauge perceptions of the extent of organizational bullsh\\*t that exists in a workplace. The research revealed three key factors of organizational bullsh\\*t:\n\n#### Factor 1. Bullsh\\*t Tolerance\n\nThe tolerance for bullsh\\*t seems to be more pervasive and more accepted in some organizations than others. This variation is likely to be reflected in the extent to which an organization has a culture of **seeking and using evidence to support statements**, as opposed to it being more commonplace to rely on hunches, anecdotes, and personal experiences and opinions. Does the organization reward, accept, ignore, or challenge bullsh\\*t statements?\n\nWhile organizational disregard for the truth may be accepted under certain circumstances, such disregard may lead to organizations making more questionable decisions that could alienate employees. Employees are exceptionally tuned to recognize bullsh\\*t and this is a source of frustration for many of them. Worse, management could actually believe the bullsh\\*t, and that could ultimately put everyone\'s jobs at risk by endangering the welfare of the company.\n\nWe can measure factor 1 by measuring the extent to which employees believe their organization has a culture that expects workplace statements and discussions **to be grounded in truth** and be **supported by evidence and data**.\n\n#### Factor 2. Leadership Bullsh\\*t\n\nThe second factor concerns the communication behavior of high-status individuals in organizations. Since senior leaders are the most important and influential bullsh\\*tters in organizations, we should measure subordinates’ perceptions of whether their bosses tend to engage in bullsh\\*t-related practices.\n\nEmployees believe that their superiors are key players in the dissemination of corporate bullsh\\*t. Further, employees are likely to have to act based on any bullsh\\*t communicated by their bosses. As a result, employees are acutely aware when their superiors use bullsh\\*t to advance their own self-interests.\n\n\u003e “We’re really excited about... (_the thing that no one in history has ever been excited about_)”\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003ccite\u003e- Delivered in a joyless monotone\u003c/cite\u003e\n\nBullsh\\*t flows both ways, however. There is a simple heuristic as a boss: Are you only hearing good news? That\'s bad news.\n\nThose at the bottom of an organization have a fairly accurate view of what’s going on. They’re close to the detail; they know what\'s what. Those at the top must rely on the bubbling-up of information from below, a process that creates layers of bullsh\\*t. Individual contributors present a rosy picture of what they are working on to their line managers; who then bullsh\\*t their bosses; and so on.\n\nBy the time you are a senior leader you should know this pattern. It\'s your job to discover the truth **despite** this tendency. If your company puts more emphasis on reputation than truth; rewards good news and punishes bad; forces loyalty on its employees rather than a desire to do the right thing; then it\'s leadership\'s fault if they are being fed bullsh\\*t.\n\n\u003e “One of the most salient features of our culture is that there is so much bullshit. Everyone knows this. Each of us contributes his share. But we tend to take the situation for granted.”\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003ccite\u003e\n\u003e   - Harry Frankfurt, Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at Princeton University\n\u003e \u003c/cite\u003e\n\n#### Factor 3. Bullsh\\*t Language\n\nBullsh\\*t typically contains language that is meant to enhance the credibility of a bullsh\\*tter, while at the same time trying to flummox others so they are unable or unwilling to try to penetrate to the lack of truth behind the bullsh\\*t.\n\nCorporate jargon is one example of organizational bullsh\\*t language, whereby words or expressions are used in an attempt to legitimize something, whilst at the same time using confusing language and thinking. We all know corporate bullsh\\*t expressions when we hear them such as “architect plug-and-play functionalities”, “drive upstream convergence”, “exploit bricks-and-clicks channels”, or “disintermediate back-end communities”.\n\n\u003cdiv className="text-sm"\u003e\n  Expressions courtesy of the{\' \'}\n  \u003ca href="https://www.bullshitgenerator.com/"\u003eBullshit Generator.\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\nCorporate speak is littered with TLAs (three letter acronyms). Things have many different names that essentially mean the same thing but indicate status and inside knowledge. A new product for example may have a code name, a project name to launch it, an "insider reference" name, and an external name for public use. Which name is used internally can project either status (for those in know), or bullsh\\*t.\n\nEmployees who are bullsh\\*t targets are less likely to ask questions, or challenge, when they find it difficult to understand what has been said. Bullsh\\*t language therefore goes beyond what is said, but also incorporates **how it is said** – both components compound the actions of bullsh\\*tters.\n\nEmployees know that the excessive use of such language is a form of bullsh\\*t. They sense if a statement is riddled with meaningless language, acronyms, buzzwords, and jargon, then it is very likely to be bullsh\\*t. They also highly respect managers that protect them from bullsh\\*t - describing a good manager as a "bullsh\\*t umbrella", and a bad manager as a "bullsh\\*t funnel".\n\n### Measuring Corporate Bullsh\\*t\n\nNow we know the three key factors of organizational bullsh\\*t (F1: bullsh\\*t Tolerance, F2: Leadership bullsh\\*t, and F3: bullsh\\*t Language) we can attempt to measure those factors. The Organizational Bullshit Perception Scale (OBPS) has identified statements that can be used to measure each of the factors:\n\n| Scale item                                                                                                                     |   F1 |   F2 |   F3 |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---: | ---: | ---: |\n| 1.

The tool also enables the identification of specific factors so that these can then be addressed:\n\n- Does communication in the organization occur without regard for evidence?\n- Do senior executives purvey bullsh\\*t in their communication?\n- Is there excessive use of acronyms (e.g. CPC, LBH, NBD) and jargon?\n\nIn the workplace there are three responses from individuals that work to promote or hinder the prevalence of organizational bullsh\\*t:\n\n1. **Disengage** (they try to escape the bullsh\\*t, or simply disengage from the bullsh\\*t),\n2. **Challenge** (they confront the bullsh\\*t), or\n3. **Loyalty** (they embrace and spread the bullsh\\*t)\n\nEmployees can be coached to challenge and/or disengage with corporate bullsh\\*t and strategies can be developed and employed for remedying corporate bullsh\\*t. For example, Dr. Jevin West is a professor of information science at the University of Washington who co-created a class at the university, “Calling Bullshit”, that teaches students how to spot and refute the way data, such as statistics and charts, can be manipulated to make false arguments. More than 60 schools have requested permission to use the materials to set up classes of their own and the material was crafted into a [book](https://www.callingbullshit.org/) published in April of 2021.\n\n### References\n\n- [On Bullshit](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691122946/on-bullshit)\n- [This Place Is Full of It: Towards an Organizational Bullshit Perception Scale](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/347253147_This_Place_Is_Full_of_It_Towards_an_Organizational_Bullshit_Perception_Scale)\n- [Bullshit: a Lexicon](https://www.amazon.com/Bullshit-A-Lexicon-Mark-Peters-ebook/dp/B00TWEMGGQ?linkCode=ogi)\n- [Calling Bullshit](https://www.callingbullshit.org/)\n- [People who are receptive to bullshit tend to overestimate their creativity ability](https://www.psypost.org/2022/06/people-who-are-more-receptive-to-bullshit-also-tend-to-overestimate-their-creativity-ability-study-finds-63373)\n\n---\n\n\u003ca name="ref"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e_**Side Note**: "Trumpery" is a real word.

        '\nHow many of us have bought a new home because our prior home was not quite meeting our needs? Maybe we needed an extra bedroom, or wanted a bigger backyard? Now, as a thought experiment, assume you _couldn\'t sell your existing home_. If you bought a new home, you\'d have to "retire" or "decommission" your prior home (and your investment in it). Does that change your thinking?\n\nFurther, imagine you had a team of five people maintaining your prior home, improving it, and keeping it updated, for the last ten years. You\'d have a cumulative investment of 50 person/years in your existing home (5 people x 10 years) just in maintenance, on top of the initial investment. If each person was paid the equivalent of a software developer (we\'ll use $200k to include benefits, office space, leadership, etc.) you\'d have an investment just in labor of **$10 million dollars** (50 person/years x $200,000). Would you walk away from that investment?\n\nWhen companies decide to re-write or replace an existing software application, they are making a similar decision. Existing software is "retired" or "decommissioned" (along with its cumulative investment). Yet the belief that new code is always better than old is patently absurd. Old code has weathered and withstood the test of time. It has been battle-tested. You know it\'s failure modes. Bugs have been found, and more importantly, fixed.\n\nJoel Spolsky (of Fog Creek Software and Stack Overflow) describes system re-writes in "[Things You Should Never Do, Part I](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/)" as “the single worst strategic mistake that any software company can make.”\n\nContinuing our home analogy, recent price increases for construction materials like lumber, drywall, and wiring (and frankly everything else) should, according to Economics 101, cause us to treat our current homes more dearly. Similarly, price increases for quality software engineers should force companies to treat existing software more dearly.\n\nLots of current software started out as C software from the 1980s. Engineers don\'t often write software with portability as a goal at the beginning, but once something is relatively portable, it tends to stay that way. Code that was well designed and written often migrated from mini-computers to i386, from i386 to amd64, and now ARM and arch64, with a minimum of redesign or effort. You can take large, complicated programs from the 1980s written in C, and compile/run them on a modern Linux computer - even when the modern computer is running architectures which _hadn\'t even been dreamt of when the software was originally written_.\n\nWhy can\'t software last forever? It\'s not made of wood, concrete, or steel. It doesn\'t "wear out", rot, weather, or rust. A working algorithm is a working algorithm. Technology doesn’t need to be beautiful, or impress other people, to be effective. Aren\'t technologists ultimately in the business of producing cost effective technology?\n\nI am going to attempt to convince you that _maintaining_ your existing systems is one the most cost-effective technology investments you can make.\n\n## The World\'s Oldest Software Systems\n\nIn 1958, the United States Department of Defense launched a new computer-based contract management system called "Mechanization of Contract Administration Services", or MOCAS (pronounced “MOH-cass”). In 2015, [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2015/08/06/166822/what-is-the-oldest-computer-program-still-in-use/) stated that MOCAS was the oldest computer program in continuous use they could verify. At that time MOCAS managed about $1.3 trillion in government obligations and 340,000 contracts.\n\nAccording to the [Guinness Book of World Records](https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/636196-oldest-software-system-in-continuous-use), the oldest software system in use today is either the [SABRE](\u003chttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabre_(travel_reservation_system)\u003e) Airline Reservation System (introduced in 1960), or the IRS Individual Master File (IMF) and Business Master File (BMF) systems introduced in 1962–63.\n\nSABRE went online in 1960. It had cost $40 million to develop and install (about **$400 million** in 2022 dollars). The system took over all American Airlines booking functions in 1964, and the system was expanded to provide access to external travel agents in 1976.\n\nWhat is the secret to the long lifespan of these systems? Shouldn\'t companies with long-lived products (annuities, life insurance, etc.) study these examples? After all, they need systems to support products that _last most of a human lifespan_. However, shouldn\'t _all companies_ want to their investments in software to last as long as possible?\n\n## Maintenance is About Making Something Last\n\nWe spoke of SABRE above, and we know that airlines recognize the value of maintenance. Commercial aircraft are inspected **at least once every two days**. Engines, hydraulics, environmental, and electrical systems all have additional maintenance schedules. A "heavy" maintenance inspection occurs once every few years. This process maintains the aircraft\'s service life over decades.\n\nOn average, an aircraft is operable for about 30 years before it must be retired. A Boeing 747 can endure 35,000 pressurization cycles — roughly 135,000 to 165,000 flight hours — before metal fatigue sets in. However, most older airframes are retired for fuel-efficiency reasons, not because they\'re worn out.\n\nEven stuctures made of grass can last indefinitely. [Inca rope bridges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inca_rope_bridge) were simple suspension bridges constructed by the Inca Empire. The bridges were an integral part of the Inca road system were constructed using ichu grass.\n\n![Inca Rope Bridge](/assets/blog/img/inca_bridge.jpg)\n\nEven though they were made of grass, these bridges were maintained with such regularity and attention **they lasted centuries**. The bridge\'s strength and reliability came from the fact that _each cable was replaced every June_.\n\nThe goal of maintenance is **catching problems before they happen.** That’s the difference between _maintenance_ and _repair_. Repair is about fixing something that’s already broken. **Maintenance is about making something last.**\n\n## Unfortunately, Maintenance is Chronically Undervalued\n\nMaintenance is one of the easiest things to cut when budgets get tight. Some legacy software systems have _decades_ of underinvestment in maintenance. This leads up to the inevitable "we have to replace it" discussion - which somehow always sounds more persuasive (even though it’s more expensive and riskier) than arguing to invest in system rehabilitation and deferred system maintenance.\n\nExecutives generally can\'t refuse "repair" work because the system is broken and must be fixed. However, maintenance is a tougher sell. It’s not strictly necessary — or at least it doesn’t seem to be until things start falling apart. It is so easy to divert maintenance budget into a halo project that gets an executive noticed (and possibly promoted) before the long-term effects of underinvestment in maintenance become visible. Even worse, the executive is also admired for reducing the costs of maintenance and switching costs from "run" to "grow" - while they are torpedoing the company under the waterline.\n\nThe other challenge is conflating enhancement work with maintenance work. Imagine you have $1,000 and you want to add a sunroof to your car, but you also need new tires (which coincidentally also cost $1,000). You have to replace the tires every so often, but a sunroof is "forever" right? If you spend the money on the sunroof the tires could get replaced next month, or maybe the month after - they\'ll last a couple more months, won\'t they?\n\nWith software, users can\'t see "the bald tires" - they only thing they see, or experience (and value), are new features and capabilities. Pressure is always present to cut costs _and_ to add new features. The result is budget **always** swings away from maintenance work towards enhancements.\n\nFinally, maintenance work is typically an operational cost, yet building a new system, or a significant new feature, can often be capitalized - making the future costs someone else\'s problem.\n\n## Risks of Replacing Software Systems\n\nIt\'s usually not the design or the age of a system that causes it to fail but rather _neglect_. People fail to maintain software systems because they are _not given the time, incentives, or resources to maintain them_.\n\n\u003e "Most of the systems I work on rescuing are not badly built. **They are badly maintained.**"\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003ccite\u003e\u0026mdash; Marianne Bellotti, Kill it With Fire\u003c/cite\u003e\n\nOnce a system degrades it is an enormous challenge to fund deferred maintenance (or "technical debt"). No one plans for it, no one wants to pay for it, and no engineer wants to do it. Initiatives to restore operational excellence, much the way one would fix up an old house, tend to have few volunteers among engineering teams. No one gets noticed doing maintenance. No one ever gets promoted because of maintenance.\n\nIt should be clear why engineers prefer to re-write a system rather than maintain it. They get to "write a new story" rather than edit someone else\'s. They will attempt to convince a senior executive to fund a project to replace a problematic system by describing all the new features and capabilities that could be added as well as how "bad" the existing, unmaintained, system has become. Further, they will get to use modern technology that makes them much more valuable in the market.\n\nIncentives aside, engineering teams tend to gravitate toward system rewrites because they incorrectly think of old systems as specs. They assume that since an old system works, the functional risks have been eliminated. They can focus on adding more features to the new system or make changes to the underlying architecture without worry. Either they do not perceive the ambiguity these changes introduce, or they see such ambiguity positively, imagining only gains in performance and the potential for innovation.\n\nWhy not authorize that multimillion-dollar replacement if the engineers convince management the existing system is doomed? Eventually a "replacement" project will be funded (typically at a much higher expenditure than rehabilitating the existing system). Even if the executives are not listening to the engineers, they will be listening to external consultants telling them they are falling behind.\n\nWhat do you do with the old system while you’re building the new one? Most organizations put the old system on “life support” and give it only the resources for patches and fixes necessary to keep it running. This reduces maintenance even further and becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy that the existing system will eventually fail.\n\nWho gets to work on the new system, and who takes on the maintenance tasks of the old system? If the old system is written in older technology that the company is actively abandoning, the team maintaining the old system is essentially sitting around waiting to be fired. And don’t kid yourself, they know it. If the people maintaining the old system are not participating in the creation of the new system, you should expect that they are also looking for new jobs. If they leave before your new system is operational, you lose both their expertise and their institutional knowledge.\n\nIf the new project falls behind schedule (and it almost certainly will), the existing system continues to degrade, and knowledge continues to walk out the door. If the new project fails and is subsequently canceled, the gap between the legacy system and operational excellence has widened _significantly_ in the meantime.\n\nThis explains why executives are loathe to cancel system replacement projects even when they are obviously years behind schedule and failing to live up to expectations. Stopping the replacement project seems impossible because the legacy system is now so degraded that restoring it to operational excellence seems impossible. Plus, politically canceling a marquee project can be career suicide for the sponsoring executive(s). Much better to do "deep dives" and "assessments" on why the project is failing and soldier on than cancel it.\n\nThe interim state is not pretty. The company now has two systems to operate, much higher costs and new risks.\n\n- The new system will have high costs, limited functionality, new and unique errors/issues, and lower volumes (so the "per unit cost" of the new system will be quite high).\n- The older system will still be running most of the business, and usually **all** of the complex business, while having lost its best engineers and subject matter experts. Its maintenance budget will have been whittled down to nothing to redirect spending to implement (save?) the new system. This system will be in grave danger to significant system failure (which proponents of the new system will use to justify the investment in the new system, not admitting to a self-fulfilling prophecy).\n\nNeither system will exhibit operational excellence, and both put the organization at significant risk in addition to the higher costs and complexity of running two systems.\n\n## Maintaining Software to Last Forever\n\nAs I discussed in [How Software Learns](/posts/2022-06-05-how-software-learns), software adapts over time - as it is continually refined and reshaped by maintenance and enhancements. **Maintenance** is crucial to software\'s lifespan and business relevance/value. When software systems are first developed, they are based on a prediction of the future - a prediction of the future that we know is wrong even as we make it. No set of requirements have ever been perfect. However, all new systems become "less wrong" as time, experience, and knowledge are continually added (e.g., maintenance).\n\nFutureproofing means constantly rethinking and iterating on the existing system. We know from both research and experience that iterating and maintaining existing solutions is a much more likely, and less expensive, way to improve software\'s lifespan and functionality.\n\nBefore choosing to replace a system that needs deferred maintenance remember _it’s the lack of maintenance that create the impression that failure is inevitable_, and pushes otherwise rational engineers and executives toward rewrites or replacements. What mechanisms will prevent lack of maintenance from eventually dooming the brand-new system? Has the true root problem been addressed?\n\nRobust maintenance practices could preserve software for decades, but first maintenance must be valued, funded, and applied. To maintain software properly we have to consider:\n\n1. How do you measure the overall health of a system?\n1. How do you define and manage maintenance work?\n1. How do you define a reasonable maintenance budget? _How can you protect that budget?_\n1. How do you motivate engineers to perform maintenance?\n\n### 1. How do you measure the overall health of a system?\n\n#### Objective measures\n\n1. **Maintenance Backlog** — If you added up **all** the open work requests, including work the software engineers deem necessary to eliminate technical debt, what is the total amount of effort? Now, divide that by the team capacity. For example, imagine you have a total amount of work of 560 days, and you have one person assigned to support the system - they work approximately 200 days annually. The backlog in days in 560, but in time it is 2.8 years (560 days / 200 days/year = 2.8 years). What is a reasonable amount of backlog time?\n\n1. **System Reliability/Downtime** — If you added up **all** the time the system is down in a given period, what is the total amount? What is the user or customer impact of that downtime? Conversely, what would reducing that downtime be worth? What is the relationship of maintenance and downtime? In other words, does the system need to be taken down to maintain it (planned maintenance)? Does planned maintenance reduce unplanned downtime?\n\n1. **Capacity/Performance Constraints** — Is the existing hitting capacity constraints that will prevent future growth of the business? How unpredictable are the system capacity demands? What is the customer experience when the system capacity is breached? What is relationship between hardware and software that constrains the system? Is the software performant? Can hardware solve the problem?\n\n#### Subjective measures\n\n1. **User Satisfaction**: User satisfaction includes both how happy your employees are with the applications and/or how well those applications meet your customer\'s needs. Many times I have found the technology team and the business users arguing over "bug" vs. "enhancement". It is a way of assigning blame. "Bug" means its engineering\'s fault, "enhancement" means it was a missed requirement. When emotions run hot it means that the maintenance budget is insufficient. I always tell everyone they are both just maintenance and the only important decision is which to prioritize and fix first.\n\n1. **“Shadow IT”** — If you used applications in the past that didn’t meet employees’ needs, and didn’t have a good governance plan to address problems, you may have noticed employees found other solutions on their own. This is an indication of underfunded maintenance.\n\n1. **Adaptable Architecture** — "The cloud", API-based integration, and unlocking your data are no longer “nice to haves.” Your architecture needs to adapt. If these are challenges, then the architecture must be addressed.\n\n1. **Governance** — Healthy application architecture isn’t just about technology—it’s also about having well-documented and well-understood governance documents that guide technology investments for your organization. Good governance helps create adaptable architecture and avoid “shadow IT” applications.\n\n### 2. How do you define maintenance work?\n\nThere are four general types of software maintenance. The first two types take up the majority of most organizations\' maintenance budget, and _may not even be considered maintenance_ - however, all four types must be funded adequately for software to remain healthy. If you can\'t fully address types three and four your maintenance budget is inadequate.\n\n#### 1. Corrective Software Maintenance (more accurately called "repair")\n\nCorrective software maintenance is necessary when something goes wrong in a piece of software including faults and errors. These can have a widespread impact on the functionality of the software in general and therefore must be addressed as quickly as possible. However, it is important to consider repair work separate from the other types of maintenance because repair work must get done. Note: this is generally the only type of work that happens when a system is put on "life support".\n\n#### 2. Perfective Software Maintenance (more accurately called "enhancements")\n\nOnce software is released and is being used new issues and ideas come to the surface. Users will think up new features or requirements that they would like to see. Perfective software maintenance aims to adjust software by adding new features as necessary (and removing features that are irrelevant or not effective). This process keeps software relevant as the market, and user needs, evolve. It there is funding beyond "life support" it usually is spent here.\n\n#### 3. Preventative Software Maintenance (true maintenance is **catching problems before they happen.**)\n\nPreventative software maintenance is looking into the future so that your software can keep working as desired for as long as possible. This includes making necessary changes, upgrades, and adaptations. Preventative software maintenance may address small issues which at the given time may lack significance but may turn into larger problems in the future. These are called latent faults which need to be detected and corrected to make sure that they won’t turn into effective faults. This type of maintenance is generally underfunded.\n\n#### 4. Adaptive Software Maintenance (true maintenance **adapts to changes**)\n\nAdaptive software maintenance is responding to the changing technology landscape, as well as new company policies and rules regarding your software. These include operating system changes, using cloud technology, security policies, hardware changes, etc. When these changes are performed, your software (and possibly architecture) must adapt to properly meet new requirements and meet current security and other policies.\n\n### 3. How do you define a reasonable maintenance budget? How can you protect that budget?\n\nIn the case of the Inca rope bridges what was the cost of maintenance annually? Let\'s assume some of the build work was site preparation and building the stone anchors on each side, but most of the work was constructing the bridge itself. Since the bridge was _entirely replaced_ each year, the maintenance costs could be as much as 80% of the initial build effort, _every year_.\n\nComparing to "software as a service" (SaaS) vendors is difficult because they have shifted to a subscription model that bundles infrastructure, enhancements, and ongoing maintenance. Prior to SaaS subscription-based pricing one would typically buy a perpetual license plus maintenance at ~20-30% annual cost of the license to obtain support and updates.\n\nSide note: Now that the SaaS annual costs are commingled, some enterprises fall into the trap that “building it is cheaper because we pay up front but then it will cost less in the long run” assuming the "long run" almost always underprices infrastructure and assumes near zero maintenance cost. In the case of a brand-new, internally designed and developed software system - one that is well architected, well designed, well built, and meets all reliability, scalability, and performance needs (i.e., fantasy software) it\'s conceivable that there is no maintenance necessary for some period of time - but **very** unlikely.\n\nSo, maintenance costs can have a very wide range. A general rule of thumb is 20-30% of the initial build cost will be required for ongoing maintenance work annually. However, maintenance costs usually start off lower and increase over time. They are also unpredictable costs that are hard to budget.\n\nThe challenges should be obvious. First, budgets in large organizations tend be last year\'s budget plus 2-3%. If you start with a maintenance budget of zero on a new system, how do you ever get to the point of a healthy maintenance budget in the future? Second, maintenance costs are unpredictable, and organizations _hate_ unpredictable costs. It\'s impossible to say when the next new hardware, or storage, or programming construct will occur, or when the existing system will hit a performance or scalability inflection point.\n\nThis is like buying a brand-new car. The maintenance costs are negligible in the first couple years, until they start to creep up. Then things start to need maintenance, replacement, or repair. As the car ages the maintenance costs continue to increase until at some point it makes economic sense to buy another new car. _Except none of us wait that long._ Most of us buy new cars before our old one is completely worn out. As a counter-example, in Cuba some cars have been maintained meticulously for 30-40 years and _run better than new_.\n\n#### Protecting your maintenance budget - creating a "maintenance fund"\n\nWe know that maintenance cost increase over time, and the costs of proper maintenance are unpredictable. In addition, there is some amount of management discretion that can be applied. When your house needs a new roof it\'s reasonable to defer it through summer, but it probably needs to be done before winter.\n\nSince business require predictability of costs, unpredictable maintenance costs are easy to defer. "We didn\'t budget for that; we\'ll have to put it in next year\'s budget." Except of course in the budget process it will compete with other projects and enhancement work, where it\'s again likely to be deprioritized.\n\nWhat\'s the solution? Could it be possible to create some type of maintenance fund where a predictable amount is budgeted each year, and then spent "unpredictably" when/as needed? Could this also be a solution to preventing executives from diverting maintenance budget into pet projects by protecting this maintenance fund in some fashion?\n\n### 4. How do you motivate software engineers to perform maintenance?\n\nThere is a Chinese proverb about a discussion between a king and a famous doctor. The well-known doctor explains to the king that his brother (who is also a doctor) is superior at medicine, but he is unknown because he always successfully treats small illnesses, preventing them from evolving into more serious or terminal ones. So, people say "Oh he is a fine doctor, but he only treats minor illnesses". It\'s true: [Nobody Ever Gets Credit for Fixing Problems that Never Happened.](https://web.mit.edu/nelsonr/www/Repenning=Sterman_CMR_su01_.pdf)\n\nTo most software engineers, legacy systems seem like torturous dead-end work, but the reality is systems that are not important get turned off. Working on "estate" systems means working on some of the most critical systems that exist — computers that govern millions of people’s lives in enumerable ways. This is not the work of technical janitors, but _battlefield surgeons_.\n\nEngineering loves new technology. It gains the engineers attention and industry marketability. [Boring technology](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2013/02/in-praise-of-boring-technology/) on the other hand is great for the **company**. The engineering cost is lower, and the skills are easier to obtain and keep, because these engineers are not being pulled out of your organization for double their salary by Amazon or Google.\n\nWell-designed, high-functioning software that is easy to understand usually blends in. Simple solutions do not do much to enhance one’s personal brand. Therefore, when an organization provides limited pathways to promotion for software engineers, they tend to make technical decisions that emphasize their individual contribution and technical prowess. You have to be very careful to reward what you want from your engineering team.\n\nWhat earns them the acknowledgment of their peers? What gets people seen is what they will ultimately prioritize, even if those behaviors are in open conflict with the official direction they receive from management. In most organizations shipping new code gets attention, while technical debt accrues silently in the background.\n\nThe specific form of acknowledgment also matters a lot. Positive reinforcement in the form of social recognition tends to be a more effective motivator than the traditional incentive structure of promotions, raises, and bonuses. Behavioral economist Dan Ariely attributes this to the difference between social markets and traditional monetary-based markets. Social markets are governed by social norms (read: peer pressure and social capital), and they often inspire people to work harder and longer than much more expensive incentives that represent the traditional work-for-pay exchange. In other words, _people will work really hard for positive reinforcement from their peers_.\n\n## Legacy System Modernization\n\nUnmaintained software will certainly die at some point. Due to factors discussed above, software does not always receive the proper amount of maintenance to remain healthy. Eventually a larger modernization effort may become necessary to restore a system to operational and functional excellence.\n\nLegacy modernization projects start off feeling easy. The organization once had a reliable working system and kept it running for years. All the modernizing team should need to do is simply reshape it using better technology, better architecture, the benefit of hindsight, and improved tooling. It should be simple. But, because people do not see the hidden technical challenges they are about to uncover, they also assume the work will be boring. There’s little glory to be had re-implementing a solved problem.\n\nModernization projects are also typically the ones organizations just want to get out of the way, so they launch into them unprepared for the time and resource commitments they require. Modernization projects take months, if not years of work. Keeping a team of engineers focused, inspired, and motivated from beginning to end is difficult. Keeping their senior leadership prepared to invest in what is, in effect, something they already have is a huge challenge. Creating momentum and sustaining it are where most modernization projects fail.\n\nThe hard part about legacy modernization is the "system around the system". The organization, its communication structures, its politics, and its incentives are all intertwined with the technical product in such a way that to improve the product, you must do it by turning the gears of this other, complex, undocumented system. Pay attention to politics and culture. Technology is at most only 50% of the legacy problem, ways of working, organization structure and leadership/sponsorship are just as important to success.\n\nTo do this, you need to overcome people’s natural skepticism and get them to buy in. The important word in the phrase "proof of concept" is _proof_. You need to prove to people that success is possible and worth doing. It can\'t be just an MVP, because [MVPs are dangerous.](/posts/2021-12-27-dangerous-mvps). A red flag is raised when companies talk about the phases of their modernization plans in terms of which technologies they are going to use _rather than what value they will add_.\n\nFor all that people talk about COBOL dying off, it is good at certain tasks. The problem with most old COBOL systems is that they were designed at a time when COBOL was the _only option_. Start by sorting which parts of the system are in COBOL because COBOL is good at performing that task, and which parts are in COBOL because there were no other technologies available. Once you have that mapping, start by pulling the latter off into separate services that are written and designed using the technology we would choose for that task today.\n\nGoing through the exercise of understanding what functionality is fit for use for specific languages/technologies not only gives engineers a way to keep building their skillsets but also is an opportunity to pair with other engineers who have different/complimentary skills. This exchange also has the benefit of diffusing the understanding of the system to a broader group of people without needing to solely rely on documentation (which never exists).\n\nCounterintuitively, SLAs/SLOs are valuable because they provide a "failure budget". When organizations stop aiming for perfection and accept that all systems will occasionally fail, they stop letting their technology rot for fear of change. In most cases, mean time to recovery (MTTR) is a more useful statistic to push than reliability. MTTR tracks how long it takes the organization to recover from failure. Resilience in engineering is all about recovering stronger from failure. That means better monitoring, better documentation, and better processes for restoring services, but you can’t improve any of that if you don’t occasionally fail.\n\nAlthough a system that constantly breaks, or that breaks in unexpected ways without warning, will lose its users’ trust, the reverse isn’t necessarily true. A system that never breaks doesn’t necessarily inspire high degrees of trust - and its maintenance budget _is even easier to cut_.\n\nPeople take systems that are too reliable for granted. Italian researchers Cristiano Castelfranchi and Rino Falcone have been advancing a general model of trust that postulates trust naturally degrades over time, regardless of whether any action has been taken to violate that trust. Under Castelfranchi and Falcone’s model, maintaining trust doesn’t mean establishing a perfect record; it means continuing to rack up observations of resilience. If a piece of technology is so reliable it has been completely forgotten, it is not creating those regular observations. Through no fault of the technology, the user’s trust in it slowly deteriorates.\n\nWhen both observability and testing are lacking on your legacy system, observability comes first. Tests tell you only what shouldn’t fail; monitoring tells you what _is failing_. Don’t forget: a perfect record will always be broken, but resilience is an accomplishment that lasts. Modern engineering teams use stats like service level objectives, error budgets, and mean time to recovery to move the emphasis away from avoiding failure and toward recovering quickly.\n\n## Summary\n\nMaintenance mostly happens out of sight, mysteriously. If we notice it, it’s a nuisance. When road crews block off sections of highway to fix cracks or potholes, we treat it as an obstruction, not a vital and necessary process. This is especially true in the public sector: it’s almost impossible to get governmental action on, or voter interest in, spending on preventive maintenance, yet governments make seemly unlimited funds available once we have a disaster. We are okay spending a massive amount of money to fix a problem, but consistently resist spending a much smaller amount of money to prevent it; as a business strategy this makes no sense.\n\nThe [Open Mainframe Project](https://www.openmainframeproject.org) estimates that there about 250 billion lines of COBOL code running today in the world economy, and nearly all COBOL code contains critical business logic. Companies should maintain that software and make it last as long as possible.\n\n### References\n\n- [Things You Should Never Do, Part I](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/)\n- [Patterns of Legacy Displacement](https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-legacy-displacement/)\n- [Kill It with Fire: Manage Aging Computer Systems (and Future Proof Modern Ones)](https://www.amazon.com/Kill-Fire-Manage-Computer-Systems/dp/1718501188)\n- [Building software to last forever](https://herman.bearblog.dev/building-software-to-last-forever/)\n- [The Disappearing Art Of Maintenance](https://www.noemamag.com/the-disappearing-art-of-maintenance/)\n- [Inca rope bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inca_rope_bridge)\n- [How Often Do Commercial Airplanes Need Maintenance?](https://monroeaerospace.com/blog/how-often-do-commercial-airplanes-need-maintenance/#:~:text=Commercial%20airplanes%20require%20frequent%20maintenance,inspection%20once%20every%20few%20years.)\n- [Nobody Ever Gets Credit for Fixing Problems that Never Happened](https://web.mit.edu/nelsonr/www/Repenning=Sterman_CMR_su01_.pdf)\n- [Boring Technology Club](https://boringtechnology.club/)\n- [Open Mainframe Project 2021 Annual Report](https://www.openmainframeproject.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2022/04/OMP_Annual_Report_2021_040622.pdf)\n- [How Popular is COBOL?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33999718)\n\n---\n\nImage Credit: **Bill Gates, CEO of Microsoft, holds Windows 1.0 floppy discs.**\n\n\u003cspan className="text-sm"\u003e\n  (Photo by Deborah Feingold/Corbis via Getty Images) This was the release of\n  Windows 1.0.

        '\n\u003e “We just landed one of the biggest deals in our company’s history. To close the deal, we promised the customer a few things. I trust you to make it happen.”\n\nThe conversation ended with the famous last words: **_“Don’t worry, what they want is really basic.”_**\n\nDuring the deal our CEO, CTO and CPO got together and decided that what the customer was asking for was simple and easy to build. They made commitments to the customer without involving **any** engineering teams in the process. To top it off they **agreed to a date** and threw it over the fence as well.\n\nWhen questions came up about what the customer wanted our CTO said “figure it out”, or “do whatever you think would be best”.\n\n---\n\nHas that ever happened to you? If it makes you angry consider this - The C-Suite wasn\'t estimating the time to build the feature, they were **estimating what they needed to win the business**. Successfully, I might add - job done by the C-suite!\n\nNow that the business has been won, your job is to manage the customer while the project is completed in whatever time it takes. The customer might not know exactly what they wanted, or maybe they were just pushing to see how much your company wanted the business. Maybe they actually wanted the requirements to be vague that they could change things as the project went along while keeping you (the vendor) under pressure to deliver whatever thing(s) they eventually decide they want.\n\nWhat matters is your company won the deal, and _managing the customer is now your most important job_, not necessarily delivering specific features.\n\n## Twelve rules of estimates\n\n### 1. Estimates are a business function, not an engineering function.\n\nEstimates are used to make promises to external customers. Estimates are used to promise features (Hey Elon, when is "full self-driving" actually going to be available?). Estimates are used to plan future events (e.g., we need to have "X" feature ready for the summer sales conference). Finally, estmates are used to make business decisions on feature value.\n\nOnce you realize this, you can approach estimating differently. You may ask "What do we need to know to make this decision?" If this feature takes over a year to develop, is it worth doing? Or, we can ask the development team "what are the odds this feature can be developed in less than a year?" From there we can make an informed business decision.\n\nOr, if we need something to show at the next sales conference then the question is not "will this specific feature be ready?" but rather "**What** can we have ready for the upcoming meeting in two months?"\n\n### 2. Reality is unaffected by estimates.\n\nHow many pennies are in this jar?\n\n![pennies in a jar](/assets/blog/img/pennies.jpg)\n\nWhatever estimate you come up with, whatever methodology you used, I bet your estimate is wrong. It\'s either more or less wrong, but it\'s not exactly right.\n\nNow for the key point: your estimate does not influence how many pennies are present. **Reality is unaffected by your guess.**\n\nThe same logic applies to estimating or forecasting software delivery timelines. Delivering a feature still takes a certain amount of time, regardless of the estimate. Software delivery cannot be late or early - it simply takes whatever it takes. It is our _expectations_ that create a perception of late or early delivery.\n\n### 3. Estimates are just predictions.\n\nIt’s also generally a prediction we make with too little information. When doing complex work, at the start we know we lack information. Our information and understanding are limited to the extent that getting the estimate close probably means we we have some experience, but we also got lucky, just like when guessing the number of pennies in the jar.\n\nOne of the best tools for estimation, is not an estimation technique at all, but a **communication technique**. Try giving 30/60/90 estimates:\n\n- I\'m **30% confident** it\'ll be done in 20 days,\n- **60% confident** it\'ll be done in 45 days, and\n- **90% confident** it\'ll be done in 60 days.\n\nIf the product manager or sponsor say "great, we\'ll plan on 45 days," remind them that there\'s nearly even odds we don\'t hit that.\n\nIf they complain that the range is too wide ("How can it be 20-60 days? I need more confidence!") then you can use that as justification for exercises which increase confidence (prototyping, more detailed planning, research any unknowns, etc).\n\nThe important thing is to **make it impossible for someone receiving your estimate to ignore the uncertainty in the numbers** you give.\n\n### 4. The only thing worse than estimating is imposing estimates on others.\n\nNothing is more frustrating than forcing estimates on a team. Because those estimates will turn out to be incorrect, the team that tries to deliver on them will develop feelings of resentment toward those that produced the original estimates.\n\nThrowing estimates over the fence is a sure-fire way to start a blame game where everybody blames each other. At a minimum - involve those responsible for delivery in the estimation process.\n\n### 5. Estimates become more reliable closer to the completion of the project (when they are the least useful).\n\nEarly on in a project, you know the least, so your estimates will be the least accurate. Paradoxically, this is also the moment when you’d like to know most about the required effort of your project, as you can pull the plug on the project without having to exert any effort.\n\nAs the project progresses, you will gain a better understanding, and have a lot more information about what needs to happen. Your estimates will become significantly more accurate. However, as more and more of the project is completed, the accuracy of your estimates becomes less important. Also, because of the time you’ve already invested in the project, companies become less likely to change the business decision (i.e. quit development).\n\n### 6. The more you have to worry about your estimates, the more certain you can be that you have bigger things you should be worrying about instead.\n\nEstimates are a red herring. It’s easy to get distracted and believe accurate estimates and meeting timelines are what matters most. However, as said before, it takes what it takes.\n\nWhen teams try to meet the imaginary timeline produced by the crystal ball, tunnel vision creeps in. The only thing everyone sees is the looming deadline. The whole discussion reverts to ‘How can we meet that deadline?’ while ‘Is it good enough?’ moves to the backseat, and ‘How can we move faster?’ climbs into the driver’s seat.\n\nObsessive focus on ‘When will it be done?’ guarantees you will move quality to the backseat. Yet, "am I doing high quality and high value work?" is the most important question in the long run.\n\n### 7. When you suck at building software, your estimates will suck. When you’re great at building software, your estimates will probably still suck.\n\n**The ability to estimate accurately has little bearing on your ability to build great software.**\n\nBetter teams will usually produce better estimates, but those better estimates still aren’t good enough to deliver accurately.\n\nLike the weatherman who cannot predict the weather accurately more than a week in advance, software development teams quickly reach a ceiling in how accurately, and how far in the future, they can predict outcomes.\n\n_"Instead of being angry at the winds you will never be able to predict and control simply adjust your sails."_\n\n### 8. The biggest value in estimating isn’t the estimate but rather creating a common understanding.\n\nWhen estimating, a different estimate usually means there is a conflicting understanding of what needs to happen. By talking about the work to be done, differences in opinion of what needs to happen surface.\n\n**Creating a common understanding is the biggest value in estimation**, not the actual estimate itself (which will turn out to be wrong).\n\n### 9. Keeping things simple is the best way to increase the accuracy of estimates.\n\nRemoving complexity and uncertainty, either by doing the work or before you start doing the work, is the best way to increase accuracy of estimates. Keeping things simple is the best way to prevent your estimates from ballooning.\n\n### 10. Building something increases the accuracy of estimates more than talking about building it.\n\nIt’s appealing to talk, analyze, design, debate, and do infinite research before starting the work to abolish all uncertainty and risk. However, no matter what you do, you’re still limited to the knowledge of what you can know before starting the work. You quickly experience diminishing returns from trying to draw conclusions based on inadequate information.\n\nBy doing the work and starting, you discover the real problems that matter sooner. Work with what you do know to discover what you don’t know. Being book smart won’t cut it, you need to be street smart too.\n\nMy grandfather always said: "The sooner you start, the sooner you finish."\n\n### 11. Breaking all the work down to the smallest details to arrive at a better estimate means you will deliver the project later.\n\nOur usual response to produce a better estimate is to sit endlessly in meeting rooms and break everything down to the smallest detail. By doing this, we lose valuable time we could spend actually doing the work. As stated before, this is where you discover the problems that matter.\n\nOn top of this, all those elaborate plans are detached from reality and will ultimately slow you down more and more as the project goes on (because you will have to continually explain why your plan is not matching reality).\n\nSticking to the plan as it deviates more and more is a dangerous thing. It is better to start with simpler plans that are easier to adjust. When you break down the whole project to the smallest details, you create a false sense of precision.\n\nHowever, you can add more detailed breakdowns as you progress and learn.\n\n### 12. Punishing wrong estimates is often like punishing a child for something they don’t (and can’t) know yet.\n\nSome companies believe that it’s possible to produce perfect estimates as teams mature and become stronger. Therefore, any team that is not able to produce accurate estimates is incompetent.\n\nWhen you punish teams for making inaccurate estimates, you are likely penalizing them for things that are out of their control.\n\nIt’s like punishing a kid for something they can’t and don’t understand yet. It’s a form of bullying that leads to panic and anxiety without producing any tangible benefits.\n\nStop wasting time on the delusion you will ever be able to produce perfectly accurate estimates and focus on making sure your team is always working on the highest value items.\n\n## Summary\n\nIf you’re confident you’re making the best progress you can towards delivering something valuable, does it make a difference if it’s slower (or faster) than expected? Especially if that expectation was flawed and imprecise to begin with?\n\nCommunication is always key - as the effort more becomes clear, keeping management updated about new information, new challenges and particularly progress towards the goal is critically important. As long as the organization (or client) feels part of the process and has current information the friction will be lower. Most importantly, staying focused on quality and a value will never steer you wrong in the long run.\n\n\u003e "Hofstadter\'s Law: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter\'s Law."\n\n### References\n\n- [Hofstadter\'s law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter%27s_law)\n',

He feels like he’s doing the best work of his career, cranking out tons of great stuff, going way above and beyond. It feels great and he can’t wait for his review when Gloria will recognize all his effort and contribution.\n\nExcept one day, in one of their one-on-ones, Gloria takes a deep breath and tells him that he’s underperforming.\n\nThe first thing Bob feels is shock. Underperforming? Really? Then he feels anger at Gloria for not seeing things the way he does. How could she be so blind to all his hard work? Then he feels dejected that his manager’s view of him is so far from his own, and then there’s the wave of self-doubt: maybe his best just isn’t good enough, or maybe this team will just never value his strengths and he’ll have to move on. Resignation starts to set in.\n\nGloria is just as frustrated, because try as she might to explain what she sees as very basic responsibilities Bob is dropping, it doesn’t seem to stick. Things are suffering because of Bob’s negligence, but the message just doesn’t seem to get through to him. When she suggests specifics that he could work on, Bob reacts with exasperation. To him, it seems Gloria is just piling time-consuming minutiae on top of the real, significant contributions already taking up all his time.\n\nBob’s problem: he is performing an incomplete role, doing some work exceptionally well but in a way that leaves other necessary work undone. It\'s "donut shaped" - there is a hole in the middle. He’s doing what he judges is valuable and important, but not the complete role his manager is asking from him.\n\nMost feedback loops don’t address this type of gap well. A lot of review conversations tend to focus on strengths, weaknesses, and specific work results. These seem like reasonable topics, and there’s value there, but I also find this often leads to a review that looks like this:\n\n![Personal Score 1](/assets/blog/img/bob1.jpg)\n\nThis the “Dungeons \u0026 Dragons Character Sheet” model of professional evaluation. You could literally do that if you wanted:\n\n![Personal Score 2](/assets/blog/img/bob2.jpg)\n\nThis is clearly **not** a good measure of Bob\'s value to the team.\n\nMany of you may be thinking that Bob and Gloria need to agree on his job description, but how many of us have ever really used a job description to define our role? How many of us have pulled out our job description in a conversation with our manager? Not many I suspect, but perhaps it could be valuable exercise if it leads to the discussion of what Gloria _values_ in the role.\n\nThe key challenge in this case is Bob is making his own determination of what is valuable, and his view isn’t aligned with Gloria’s. If Bob and Gloria could align on her view of what work is valuable and important, their conversations would be much more productive. During conversations about performance, Bob and Gloria must start there. If Bob thinks what Gloria is asking for isn\'t important he needs to ask Gloria about the value of that work from her perspective. He needs to ask her what a "complete role" looks like from her view, and he needs to try to understand the value associated with performing a complete role.\n\nAre you performing a "complete role"?\n',

        '\nOur updated [National Cybersecurity Strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/National-Cybersecurity-Strategy-2023.pdf) was released on March 2, 2023. The strategy focuses on five key pillars designed to improve national and global cybersecurity for the public and private sectors:\n\n1.\t**Defend Critical Infrastructure**\n2.\t**Disrupt and Dismantle Threat Actors**\n3.\t**Shape Market Forces to Drive Security and Resilience**\n    * This item shifts liability to software vendors: “We must rebalance the responsibility to defend cyberspace by shifting the burden for cybersecurity away from individuals, small businesses, and local governments, and onto the organizations that are most capable and best positioned to reduce risks for all of us.”\n4.\t**Invest in a Resilient Future**\n5.\t**Forge International Partnerships to Pursue Shared Goals**\n\nItem number three is a wake-up call to all organizations that develop software, whether for internal or external use. Developers who fail to take reasonable precautions to secure their software will be held liable - the White House plans to work with Congress to create legislation that establishes liability for software products and services. \n\nThe White House’s strategy is clearly designed to put the onus for developing, deploying, and maintaining secure software on software makers. It states that too many vendors “ignore best practices for secure development, ship products with insecure default configurations or known vulnerabilities, and integrate third-party software of unvetted or unknown provenance.”\n\n\u003e“Companies that make software must have the freedom to innovate, but they must also be held liable when they fail to live up to the duty of care they owe consumers, businesses, or critical infrastructure providers. Responsibility must be placed on the stakeholders most capable of taking action to prevent bad outcomes, not on the end-users that often bear the consequences of insecure software…”\n\u003e\n\u003e \u0026mdash; National Cybersecurity Strategy, 2023\n\n## Implications for the Software Industry\n\n* **Improved Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) practices.** This is clearly a focus of this strategy. Software quality and security must be “baked in” to the design and development processes, not “inspected in” after the fact.  This will lead to improved processes, and more automation, specifically testing and deployment.\n\n* **Adoption of a comprehensive DevSecOps approach, integrating security and compliance into the developer experience.**  DevSecOps tools automate security workflows within the development and deployment processes. By embedding security into the software development lifecycle, you can more consistently secure fast-moving and iterative processes.\n  * Developers will need to secure their end-to-end software supply chain, including source, build, dependencies, and release artifacts - and demonstrate their software is trustworthy via [SLSA](https://slsa.dev/)\n  * Developers will need a [software bill of materials (SBOM)](https://www.cisa.gov/sbom) to track the attack surface of the applications they create. GitHub just [introduced a new feature](https://github.blog/2023-03-28-introducing-self-service-sboms/) that allows anyone with read access to a GitHub cloud repository to generate an [NTIA-compliant](https://ntia.gov/page/software-bill-materials) SBOM with a single click. The resulting JSON file saves project dependencies and metadata, like versions and licenses in the industry standard SPDX format, which can then be used with security and compliance workflows and tools.\n  * Attack surfaces such as containers must be monitored and protected alongside the application itself.\n\n* **Improved identity management.** Management of digital identity, along with secure authentication and authorization are required for a robust digital ecosystem. Today identity theft is on the rise, and fraud florishes online. Effective, secure, digital identity will protect us as individuals, and help our digital economy thrive. Software developers will have to increase their experience and expertise with identity management to avoid liability. \n\n* **Continued shift to "software as a service" business models.** The challenge with software that is locally installed has always been patching. It is impossible to write perfectly secure software, so patches are a normal, expected process. However, many companies are slow at deploying patches leaving themselves vulnerable. If vendors are going to be held more accountable (difficult for locally installed software) the natural response will be to migrate to software as a service that can be directly patched and maintained by the vendor. \n\n* **More open source software, surrounded by services.** Currently it seems the target is software, not services. This may lead to more business models where core software is open source, and surrounding the open-source software with services and enterprise support, consulting, etc. With true open-source software will be very difficult to hold any single person or organization accountable.\n\n* **More security frameworks.** With more liability comes more lawyers. Lawyers focus on limiting liability and one way to do that is by following defensible “best practice” methods. Since the White House’s strategy proposes future legislation that will include safe harbor from liability for those that follow best practices like [NIST’s Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-218.pdf) then clearly more organizations will adopt these practices. \n\n## Summary\n\nSoftware developers should know the spotlight is shifting in their direction. Prepare now for the shift of liability, and take active steps now to improve your overall security posture. DevOps makes build and deployment much more efficent, DevSecOps can provide the same benefits along with more automated testing and better security. Better digital identity managment will improve our digital economy. In the long run these are all net postives for us all.\n\n### References:\n\n* [National Cybersecurity Strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/National-Cybersecurity-Strategy-2023.pdf)\n* [NIST’s Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-218.pdf)\n* [Supply chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA)](https://slsa.dev/)\n* [Introducing self-service SBOMs](https://github.blog/2023-03-28-introducing-self-service-sboms/)',

        '\nWhen an engineer designs a bridge, they begin with the load the bridge is intended to bear, and they calculate the various stresses caused by wind, earthquakes, etc. As they choose materials to construct the bridge they have the oportunity to look up a material\'s properties in a "strength of materials" book, including its ability to withstand an applied load without failure or deformation.\n\nIn mechanical engineering one usually deals with smooth functions. As the load increases the material width or thickness needed increases proportionally. A small error (usually) results in a small propensity for failure.\n\nThe engineering process also adds a safety factor. In engineering, a "factor of safety" (FoS), expresses how much stronger a system is than it needs to be for an intended load. In a vast oversimplification, if we calcuate that a steel beam must be 12 inches wide to bear the load, let\'s double it to 24 inches "just in case" for safety purposes.\n\nBridges (all structures really) are intentionally built much stronger than needed for normal usage to allow for small miscalculations, emergency situations, unexpected loads, misuse, and degradation. \n\n### Engineering software is completely different\n\nSoftware is discrete; a single small error can result in a disproportionately large failure. A single typo in a 100,000-line program can cause it to fail catastrophically. Yes, even getting a thousandth of a percent of a program wrong can cause total failure. ([How a single line of code brought down a half-billion euro rocket launch](https://jam.dev/blog/famous-bugs-rocket-launch/))\n\nIn software development the margin of error is literally undefined behavior.\n\nNo bridge ever collapsed because the engineer got a thousandth of a percent of the building material’s properties wrong, or made a calculation a thousandth of a percent off.\n\nSoftware engineers fly blind when it comes to materials. We can\'t consult a book that will tell us how "thick" our website must be to support 100,000 users. We also frequently design with no real concept what our loads will actually be. If we are creating a new website chances are the initial volumes will be an order of magnitude lower, or higher, than we were told to expect. If it becomes popular it will have further, higher orders of magnitude higher traffic than planned.\n\nOn the positive side, the cost of changing a structure in virtual space is several orders of magnitude lower than changing a structure in physical space. In addition, software projects usually allow us to build reusable components that have tests that ensure certain behaviors - then we rerun them in various environments to make sure our assumptions still hold. We can also more reliably simulate behavior and load before we ship, which means we can load test our site before going live.\n\n### Engineering safe and secure software\n\nIn the physical world, attacking actual infrastructure like a bridge exposes the threat actors to risk - they have to be physically present (at some point). Terrorists and nation-states are willing to take that risk, whereas in the virtual space both nation states \u0026 private actors participate. \n\nThe nature of the Internet allows attackers to strike from anywhere and maintain anonymity. Attackers can replicate an attack easily without much additional effort/cost on their part. Attackers can even purchase "blueprints" for an attack that are basically the code for the attack itself. The financial motive is particularly important because it funds the ever growing arms race between offense \u0026 defense. \n\nAssessing the security of software via the question "is it secure?" is like assessing the structure of a bridge by asking the question "has it collapsed yet?" -- it is an important question, to be certain, but it also profoundly misses the point.\n\nAs discussed, engineers design bridges with built-in safety margins to guard against unforeseen circumstances (unexpectedly high winds, corrosion causing joints to weaken, a traffic accident severing support cables, et cetera); secure and reliable software could (and should) likewise be designed to tolerate failures within individual components and limit the potential damage.\n\nThe concept of "security in depth" is not new to network administrators; software engineers also apply the same engineering principles within individual applications as well. In the real world it can mean the difference between being compromised or not.\n\n### Software failure scenarios\n\nEngineers who design bridges also design for lifespan. It\'s not discussed often but all structures, including bridges, will eventually fail.\n\n\u003e "We design these things to fail at some regularity because to do otherwise would require an over-investment of resources."\n\nSoftware engineers design for scalability and reliability and hope their software can stand the test of time. Software doesn\'t rot, weather, or rust. A working algorithm is a working algorithm. However, most software changes so rapidly that its lifespan ends up being lower than a physical structure.\n\n### References\n\n- [Strength of Materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_of_materials)\n',

Working groups (sometimes called task forces) _relax hierarchy_ to allow people to solve problems across organizational units, whereas committees both reflect and _reinforce organizational boundaries and hierarchies_.\n\nWorking groups are typically initiated and staffed by people within the "implementation layer" of an organization. The goal of the working group is to solve an acute problem or tackle an opportunity.\n\nA committee is formed to advise an audience external to the committee itself, typically someone in senior leadership. Whereas a working group is typically open to those who consider themselves operating in the same space as the working group’s problem area, committees are selected by the person or entity they will be advising, and are typically closed off to everyone else.\n\nThe important takeaway here is **working groups relax organizational boundaries** while **committees reinforce them**.\n\n## Distinguishing Characteristics\n\n| Committee                                                               | Working Group                                  |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |\n| Closed Membership                                                       | Open to all who want to contribute             |\n| Members are appointed                                                   | Members volunteer (usually)                    |\n| Findings and feedback are relayed to the sponsor(s) for decision-making | Group collaborates, individuals decide and act |\n| Fact finding                                                            | Action/solution bias                           |\n| Responsible for facts                                                   | Accountable for results                        |\n| Deliver a report                                                        | Deliver a fix                                  |\n| May be political                                                        | Politics will halt progress                    |\n| Executives                                                              | Engineers                                      |\n| Meeting minutes                                                         | Wiki and Teams Channel                         |\n| Enduring                                                                | Until goal achieved                            |\n| Chairperson                                                             | Facilitator                                    |\n\n## Effective Working Groups\n\n1. **Have a a crystal clear goal.** "Restore the payroll system" is clear. "Improve Innovation" is not - and deserves an eyeroll. "Design Excellence" is not - hand that one over to a committee.\n\n   A working group is a defined set of people, usually coming from multiple teams or disciplines, with a clear problem to overcome. First and foremost, working groups are created to solve a _specific problem_ facing an organization, or take advantage of a _specific opportunity_. When the group is created, make sure the outcome is clear and measurable. Or, put another way - what is the definition of "done" when the working group will disband?\n\n2. **Staffed with people who actually have the power to fix things.**\n\n   If code is broken the group needs software engineers, if hardware has failed it needs infrastructure engineers. The working group needs all the skills to diagnose, fix, test and migrate a solution. You know what I mean - people who can _get stuff done_.\n\n3. **Have a facilitator.**\n\n   The facilitator runs meetings and keeps the group moving forward. Without a clear facilitator, meetings will become ineffective. A facilitator’s job isn’t to say yes or no; the facilitator isn’t the “decider”. Facilitation is about making sure that collabrate is happening and progress is being made.\n\n   Oh, and the facilitator doesn’t have to be a manager; facilitation can be a great leadership opportunity for individual contributors. It gives them an opportunity to flex some organization and communication muscles in a different capacity than they might be used to in their day-to-day work.\n\n   Meeting cadence is ideally "as needed". For example, a working group tackling a critical outage will meet several times a day.\n\n4. **Operate transparently.**\n\n   Since the problem you’re solving can span your whole organization, chances are that other people outside of the group will be very invested in the work that the group does. The group has to find ways to broadly share progress, get feedback, and operate transparently. Some methods for creating transparency include:\n\n   - Creating a Teams or Slack channel\n   - Sending daily or weekly update emails\n   - Creating a wiki for the group to use to document ideas and progress\n\n![Working Group](/assets/blog/img/working_group.jpg)\n\n## When is a working group not a working group?\n\n1. **When the desired outcome is not _crystal_ clear - i.e. when it\'s just another meeting.**\n\n   Some "working groups" are a just a group of people meeting on a specific topic with no real accountability or urgency. Study the cadence, topics, and invite lists of meetings. If you want to know what parts of a project or organization are suffering the most, pay attention to what the team is having meetings about, how often meetings are held, and who is being dragged into those meetings.\n\n   Meetings with a regular cadence and with ever-expanding invite lists may or may not be working groups, but do suggest something is wrong in that area and a true working group may be needed.\n\n   In particular, look for meetings with long invite lists and no real defined target outcome. Large meetings are less effective than small meetings, but they do convincingly spread the blame around by giving everyone the impression that all parties were consulted, and all opinions were explored.\n\n1. **When it\'s full of senior executives.**\n\n   Sometimes when something bad has occurred (e.g., malware has penetrated your defenses, or a key system is down) senior executives suddenly get very involved. This has the unintended effect of slowing the engineers down who are attempting to resolve the issue.\n\n   Sometimes the organization is in such a state of panic that senior leadership members are micromanaging their teams. Software engineers can’t fix problems if they spend all their time in meetings giving their managers updates about the problems. The boot must be moved off their necks.\n\n   In that situation, run two war rooms: one where the engineers are solving problems together (an actual working group) and one where the senior executives (not an actual working group) are receiving updates and studying dashboards.

        '\nThe big news in 2022 has been the rise of “generative” AI models. Generative AI models _generate_ things: text, code, images, and even music! Today we are going to check out a fun example of the technology that I created to showcase an example of how it could be used.\n\n[OpenAI\'s](https://openai.com/) GPT-3 technology refers to set of models that can understand and generate natural language. In case you are wondering "GPT" stands for “Generative Pre-trained Transformer”. This technology powers the new [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) service offered by OpenAI you may have heard about.\n\nNone of the current generative models would have been possible without the Internet. The internet created the technology where humanity could make publicly available millions (billions?) of documents, images, and software code examples. The GPT-3 models are leveraging billions of lines of text that was collected and used to train these general-purpose text generating models. In order to have this technology available in 2022 we also needed to develop sufficiently powerful GPU\'s, huge storage, and a machine learning framework to develop and train massive models.\n\nThe GPT-3 architecture is a standard transformer network (with a few engineering tweaks) with the unprecedented size of 2048-token-long context and **175 billion parameters** (requiring 800 GB of storage). It "writes" by predicting tokens, which aproximate words. According to OpenAI this is how the training process works:\n\n![ChatGPT Process](/assets/blog/img/ChatGPT_Diagram.svg)\n\nWhat can a model like this do? It writes text that is indistinguishable from a human. Here is a quick video showing the power of the technology using ChatGPT. The prompt I provided is "Generate an upbeat mission statement for a life insurance company". ChatGPT created the following response:\n\n\u003cYouTube link="https://youtu.be/UnO-c9T5Dag" /\u003e\n\nPretty amazing right?\n\nHere are the latest GPT-3 models as of this writing:\n\n| LATEST MODEL     | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                                                                                                    | MAX REQUEST  | TRAINING DATA  |\n| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | -------------- |\n| text-davinci-003 | Most capable GPT-3 model. Can do any task the other models can do, often with higher quality, longer output and better instruction-following. Also supports inserting completions within text. | 4,000 tokens | Up to Jun 2021 |\n| text-curie-001   | Very capable, but faster and lower cost than Davinci.                                                                                                                                          | 2,048 tokens | Up to Oct 2019 |\n| text-babbage-001 | Capable of straightforward tasks, very fast, and lower cost.                                                                                                                                   | 2,048 tokens | Up to Oct 2019 |\n| text-ada-001     | Capable of very simple tasks, usually the fastest model in the GPT-3 series, and lowest cost.                                                                                                  | 2,048 tokens | Up to Oct 2019 |\n\nLet\'s create a website that will analyze dreams using the most capable model (text-davinci-003) as our AI. Sound fun?\n\nHere\'s how it works: I give "text-davinci-003" a prompt: "analyze my dream". The model is then given a dream (a text string) entered on a webpage using the OpenAI API. Once the model finishes processing and returns it\'s generated text I display its response. I used [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) as the web framework and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/home) for web hosting. I registered the domain "dreamaweso.me" last week and this weekend I built out the site/service. You can try it at [DreamAweso.me](https://www.dreamaweso.me/).\n\nThe most incredible aspect of this experiment is that [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) helped me write the code, and ChatGPT wrote the disclaimer in the website footer. In other words I used generative AI technology to build a website that uses generative AI technology.\n\nIn addition, the testimonials are of course fake people - people generated by AI. The site [This Person Does Not Exist](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/) uses a GAN (generative adversarial network) called "StyleGAN2" to generate realistic human faces. I used several faces, then I used a [random name generator](https://fossbytes.com/tools/random-name-generator) to give the faces realistic names. Finally I used ChatGPT to generate the testimonial text. So the testimonials are 100% computer generated.\n\nGive it a try - it\'s fun, and I don\'t save or track anything. Anyone who has experimented with this technology comes away feeling like Aaron Levie, co-founder and CEO of the enterprise cloud company Box:\n\n\u003cCustomTweet id="1599156293050433536" /\u003e\n\n### References\n\n- [The GPT-3 Architecture, on a Napkin](https://dugas.ch/artificial_curiosity/GPT_architecture.html)\n- [Nightcap](https://www.nightcap.guru/signin)\n',

        "\n\u003eI very frequently get the question: “What’s going to change in the next 10 years?” That’s a very interesting question.\n\u003e\n\u003eI almost never get the question: “What’s **not** going to change in the next 10 years?” And I submit to you that that second question is actually the more important of the two.\n\u003e\n\u003eYou can build a business strategy around the things that are stable in time. In our retail business, we know that customers want low prices, and I know that’s going to be true 10 years from now. They want fast delivery; they want vast selection. It’s impossible to imagine a future 10 years from now where a customer comes up and says, “Jeff I love Amazon, I just wish the prices were a little higher.” Or, “I love Amazon, I just wish you’d deliver a little slower.” Impossible.\n\u003e\n\u003eSo we know the energy we put into these things today will still be paying off dividends for our customers 10 years from now. When you have something that you know is true, even over the long term, you can afford to put a lot of energy into it.\n\u003e\n\u003e\u003ccite\u003e\u0026mdash; Jeff Bezos\u003c/cite\u003e\n\nThis might seem heretical to venture capital. Change often creates bursts of opportunity. From a VC perspective things that change the world are amazing. They can fuel massive growth. For example, Andreessen Horowitz founder Marc Andreessen was once asked how his investment style compared with Warren Buffett. He replied:\n\n\u003e[Warren is] betting against change. We’re betting for change. When he makes a mistake, it’s because something changes that he didn’t expect. When we make a mistake, it’s because something doesn’t change that we thought would. We could not be more different in that way.\n\nBuffett has owned GEICO stock since 1951. During that time the company went from exclusively selling auto insurance to government employees in cafeterias, to selling several kinds of insurance to everyone on their iPhones. These are not small changes. But one thing stayed the same, which is that an insurance company selling directly would have a cost (and potentially a convenience advantage) over using brokers. That’s been the driver of Buffett’s GEICO bet for 66 years. It’s timeless.\n\nRecently, Andreessen Horowitz partner Frank Chen spoke about two trends in insurance startups. One is better software. “Software will rewrite the entire way we buy and experience our insurance products,” he said. Second is capital structure. “We expect to see more crowdsourced insurance companies … it should be a cheaper way to pool capital.” Both innovations promise lower cost and added convenience. Which is as timeless as GEICO’s edge.\n\nGrowing up, I was lucky to live near one of the early In-N-Out Burger locations in the San Gabriel valley. I probably had my first Double-Double when I was twelve or thirteen years old. I honestly believed the menu had not changed at all since then - but after doing some research, it has. In 2018 In-N-Out added hot cocoa to the menu. The last time anything changed on the menu was when they added lemonade fifteen years earlier.  Unlike some public companies In-N-Out has never complicated it's menu - not with chicken, and definitely not with salads. I wish they were a public company, I'd _love_ to have invested 20 or 30 years ago.  \n\nIn late 2009 the global economy was crippled from the sub-prime financial crisis. I heard a story about Warren Buffet's view. He was asked: \n\n\u003e“It’s so bad right now. How does the economy ever bounce back from this?”\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003eWarren said: “Do you know what the best-selling candy bar was in 1962?”\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003e“No”\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003e“Snickers” said Warren.\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003e“And do you know what the best-selling candy bar is today?” Warren said.\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003e“No”\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003e“Snickers” said Warren. \n\nWarren was saying that some things haven't changed (and thus are great bets over time). Maybe all of the focus today on \"innovation\" and \"change\" in companies today is a little bit overwrought?  Maybe we need a little more of Warren's perspective - what are we doing right that we _shouldn't_ change? \n\nConsider that every sustainable business is accompanied by a handful of timeless strategies:\n\n- Fair prices for a good product.\n- More choice.\n- More comfort.\n- More convenience.\n- Greater control over your time.\n- Greater transparency.\n- Less collateral damage to the planet.\n- Deeper human interactions.\n- Higher social status.\n- Increased confidence and trust.\n\nMake big, long-term bets on these things - people will care about them long into the future. What is something that _you know is true over the long term_ that you can afford to put a lot of energy into?\n\n### References\n\n- [What’s not going to change](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/966699-i-very-frequently-get-the-question-what-s-going-to-change)\n\n\n",

        '\nIn 2012 an article in [New Scientist](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21628936-200-why-googles-ingress-game-is-a-data-gold-mine/) described Ingress, an AR game from Google spin-off Niantic Labs, as "a data gold mine." Ingress is a mobile app tied to the real world through GPS. In the game “exotic matter” (XM) is collected as you explore your town and allows you to take control of a “portal”. You can then link it with two other portals to create a “triangle”. Your side now “owns” that territory.\n\nA detailed history of where all the players wander and the establishments they visit en route is collected. This location data is a data gold mine for Google, who knows who you are (you created an account to play), where you go (and when), who your friends are, etc. This was way back in 2012 - imagine the possibilities today.\n\nMeta, arguably the world\'s largest and most successful data monetization firm has gone all in. In late 2021 Facebook rebranded itself "Meta". The name change heralds the reorganization of the Facebook empire around a single concept: _the metaverse_.\n\n![Metaverse](/assets/blog/img/metaverse-fun.jpg)\n\nOver the course of 2021 Meta\'s Reality Labs division posted a $10.2 billion loss, earning "only" $2.3 billion after **spending $12.5 billion**. Let that sink in - Meta spent $12.5 _billion_ dollars building the metaverse in a single year. Also note the metaverse is **already** a multi-billion-dollar business.\n\nHow much of that $12.5 billion was spent on your privacy? Today "experiences" in the metaverse already replace advertising, by letting users wear virtual clothes or test drive virtual cars. All the data – who wore what, who saw what, who drove what, and for how long – is recorded and will be shared/sold by default.\n\nTo give you a sense of how valuable your data is to Meta, Apple’s decision to enable iPhone users to turn off tracking has reduced Meta’s ability to profit from you:\n\n- Revenue is down for the second consecutive quarter, quarterly profits likewise. Previously Meta never had a down quarter.\n- Meta’s market cap dropped from $1.1tn to $450bn in 10 months.\n- Metaverse real estate prices are down 80% in six months.\n\nIn addition, there is increasing interest from regulators and governments in Meta’s business practices due to the persistent smell given off by Meta’s problems with privacy, toxic content, and misinformation.\n\nAs a reminder, in 2019 Meta was fined a historic [$5 billion dollars for privacy violations](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2019/07/ftc-imposes-5-billion-penalty-sweeping-new-privacy-restrictions-facebook) in relation to the [Cambridge Analytica scandal](/posts/2018-03-16-facebook-suspends-cambridge-analytica). The $5 billion penalty against Meta was the largest ever imposed on any company for violating consumers’ privacy and almost **20 times greater than the largest privacy or data security penalty ever imposed worldwide**. It is one of the largest penalties ever assessed by the U.S. government for any violation. Yet that figure is **less than half of what Meta is willing to spend in a single year building the metaverse**.\n\n## Invasive data collection versus consumer trust\n\nIs Meta\'s metaverse a place where you will be safe, secure and private? Or, will Meta be collecting all the data it can and correlating that data with everything else they know about you and selling it to anyone who is willing to pay? Will users trust Meta to do the right thing, or will they shun Meta\'s version of the metaverse for more privacy-friendly options (for example if Apple created a similar but more private metaverse)?\n\n\u003e "Advanced technologies, especially in VR headsets and smart glasses, will track behavioral and biometric information at a record scale."\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003ccite\u003e\n\u003e   \u0026mdash; The Everest Group: "Taming the Hydra: Trust and Safety in the\n\u003e   Metaverse".\n\u003e \u003c/cite\u003e\n\nIt\'s not a stretch to see that you will be tracked everywhere you go and all your interactions logged when in the Metaverse. However, given the immersive nature of VR and AR headsets and technologies Meta could investigate deeply personal, and invasive, parts of their customers\' lives. Think about everything your smartwatch can do, but even more in-depth. It could be possible to track your breathing rate, for example, which might increase when you see something interesting.\n\nThere might even be "people" (AI driven non-playable characters - AI "influencers") approaching players to talk about a product in a casual way if eye tracking or breathing rate implies you might be interested. Think product placement and influencers on a meta-scale. Metaverse advertising could blur the line between data collection about you, advertising, and real or fake content.\n\nOr, a more frightening example - imagine a political candidate is giving a speech to millions of people in the Metaverse. While each viewer thinks they are seeing the same version of the candidate, in virtual reality they are actually each seeing a slightly different version. For each and every viewer, the candidate\'s face has been subtly modified to resemble the viewer.\n\nThis is done by blending features of each viewer\'s face into the candidate\'s face. The viewers are unaware of any manipulation of the image. Yet they are strongly influenced by it: Each member of the audience is more favorably disposed to the candidate.\n\n\u003e "In the metaverse, you may not be able to distinguish between authentic content you came upon in the world, augmented or virtual, and paid content that was injected specifically for you, personally targeted by an AI algorithm."\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003ccite\u003e\u0026mdash; Louis Rosenberg, CEO of Unanimous AI\u003c/cite\u003e\n\nAI is certainly going to be the backbone of the metaverse. However current AI technology, such as where Alexa can predict behavior, note current environmental factors, or customer preferences, will be far too simple for the metaverse. Imagine an AI in the Metaverse that befriends you simply to build out your psychological profile.\n\nThe potential data captured using VR:\n\n- **Geospatial Telemetry** (Height, Arm Length, Interpupillary Distance, and Room Dimensions);\n- **Device Identification** (Refresh Rate, Tracking Rate, Resolution, Device Field-of-View, GPU, and CPU);\n- **Network** (Bandwidth, Proximity);\n- **Behavioral Observations** (Languages, Handedness, Voice, Reaction Time, Close Vision, Distance Vision, Color Vision, Cognitive Acuity, Eye Tracking, Breathing Rate, and Fitness).\n\nFrom these metrics, various inferences can be also made about a VR participant\'s gender, sexual orientation, wealth, ethnicity, age, and disabilities. In addition, from the data collected about you in the virtual world it will be highly likely Meta will be able to identify who you are in the real, physical world. In fact, Meta will know exactly who you are at a deeper and more fundamental level than your friends and family. That\'s ironic as most people today have the impression that in virtual reality they will be free to "be whatever and whoever" they wish, separate from their real identities.\n\n![Metaverse](/assets/blog/img/metaverse-embed.jpg)\n\n## Current data protection laws\n\nThe time is now to start a dialog on the challenges of privacy and security in the metaverse. What data will you be able to ask Meta not to collect? How will Meta deal with new trust and safety challenges, such as the abuse of virtual avatars and the safety of virtual assets? Some people even wonder what legal system(s) (if any) applies to the metaverse.\n\nIf Meta is collecting biometric information, do laws like HIPAA apply? In Europe, the Data Protection Act of 1998 was only followed by GDPR in 2018. This meant it took 20 years to upgrade a more comprehensive set of regulations. Can regulators keep up?\n\nInside the US Communications Decency Act (CDA) of 1996 is one of the most valuable tools for protecting freedom of expression and innovation on the Internet: Section 230.\n\nSection 230 has given internet platforms protection from being liable for content that people post, in cases such as User-Generated Content. In other words, online intermediaries that host or republish speech are protected against a range of laws that might otherwise be used to hold them legally responsible for what others say and do. Does this extend from speech to "actions" a user might take in the Metaverse?\n\n\u003e "If the Metaverse fell outside the scope of Section 230, it would force Congress to enact a whole new law better tailored to the realities of emerging online interactions."\n\nIn the metaverse, even establishing and tracking which entity has responsibility for determining how and why personal data will be processed, and who will process personal data on behalf of another will not be straightforward. It will likely involve untangling a web of relationships and connections, and there may not be an obvious answer.\n\nSo, there are a number of questions, such as "how should these entities each display their own privacy notice to users?", "should this be done collaboratively?", "how and when should users\' consent be collected?", "who is responsible for data being lost or stolen?", and "what data sharing processes need to be put in place, and how will these be implemented?"\n\n## Additional trust and security issues\n\nPrivacy is only one of the many issues in the metaverse. Online harassment, trolling, and toxic behavior has been a problem on the Internet since modems and bulletin boards. With new levels of realism and interaction in the metaverse, new controls and limits are required. Meta has implemented a a "[Personal Boundary](https://about.fb.com/news/2022/02/personal-boundary-horizon/)" for avatars in its Horizon Worlds and Horizon Venues. Avatars are limited in how closely they can interact to prevent virtual molestation.\n\n\u003e "Personal Boundary prevents avatars from coming within a set distance of each other, creating more personal space for people and making it easier to avoid unwanted interactions..."\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003ccite\u003e\u0026mdash; Vivek Sharma, VP of Meta\'s Horizon group\u003c/cite\u003e\n\nPersonal Boundaries prevent other avatars from invading your avatar\'s personal space, without any haptic feedback to simulate a collision. Additional anti-harassment measures, such as having an avatar’s hands "disappear" if they encroach upon someone’s personal space, and a "safe zone" have been implemented. What else will be needed?\n\nMeta will need to implement privacy options and risk mitigation policies to make the metaverse a private and safe space for users. Do you trust them to so?\n\n### References\n\n- [New Scientist: Why Google\'s Ingress game is a data gold mine](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21628936-200-why-googles-ingress-game-is-a-data-gold-mine/)\n- [Taming the Hydra: Trust and Safety (T\u0026S) in the Metaverse](https://www2.everestgrp.com/reportaction/EGR-2022-67-V-5256/Marketing)\n- [Zuckerberg wants to create a make-believe world in which you can hide from all the damage Facebook has done](https://www.theregister.com/2021/10/29/zuckerberg_meta_facebook)\n- [Through the metaverse, and what can be found there](https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/through-metaverse-and-what-can-be-found-there)\n- [The metaverse has a groping problem already](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/12/16/1042516/the-metaverse-has-a-groping-problem/)\n- [FTC Imposes $5 Billion Penalty and Sweeping New Privacy Restrictions on Facebook](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2019/07/ftc-imposes-5-billion-penalty-sweeping-new-privacy-restrictions-facebook)\n- [The Metaverse Real Estate Boom Turns Into a Bust](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-metaverse-real-estate-boom-turns-into-a-bust)\n- [Facebook Misinformation Is Bad Enough.

All buildings are predictions, and all predictions are wrong. Design so that it doesn't matter.\n\n2. Whatever a client or architect says will happen with a building, won't. Whatever you are ready for, doesn't happen. Whatever you aren't ready for, does.\n\n3. Always choose the option that gives you more options. Avoid cutting off choices.\n\n4. Design decisions will keep happening through the whole process, permissions, site preparation, construction, finishing, inhabitation.\n\n5. Buildings shouldn't look exactly like their models. That's when people knew the _least_ about what's really needed.\n\n6. A building can't be finished. All buildings grow.\n\n7. Almost no buildings adapt well, but all buildings adapt anyway.\n\n8. In many fields, \"architecture\" means \"unchanging deep structure\".\n\n![Architecture in use](/assets/blog/img/arch-4.jpg)\n\n9. Buildings have architectural \"layers\". The slower layers (site, structure) constrain the quick (services, space, stuff). Keep services separate from skin as well as structure:\n\n   - STRUCTURE: foundation \u0026 load bearing, rarely changed\n   - SKIN: changes every 20 years, more air-tight, better insulated\n   - SERVICES: Plumbing, electrical, etc. - changes every 7-15 years\n   - SPACE PLAN: interior layout, walls, ceilings, floors, doors. changes every 3-30 years\n\n10. Always provide excess services capacity.\n\n11. Document the layers _as built_. Everything that is buried will be dug up some day. Leave a treasure map.\n\n    - Take photos after the services are installed but before the sheetrock/skin. Record precisely where all the services are **before they are hidden**.\n\n12. Keep scrupulous maintenance logs. Precisely what was done, when, and by who. Schedule the routines of periodic servicing and preventative maintenance.\n\n13. Over 50 years, the changes within a building cost 3x more than the original building.\n\n14. We are in denial about maintenance because when done it's just a negated negative.\n\n15. A new building is a bad teacher of maintenance habits, since deferring of maintenance is our nature.\n\n16. Spend more money than usual on the basic structure. Less on finishing. And more on maintenance.\n\n![Unique architecture](/assets/blog/img/arch-3.jpg)\n\n17. Make a building that is easy to maintain.\n\n18. Pouring concrete on the ground for an instant foundation is mal-adaptive because pipes are buried, and there is no basement space for maintenance and services access.\n\n19. Build so it's easy to make little modifications in a way that once you've made them, they feel integral with the nature and structure of what's already there. Be able to mess around with it and progressively change it, adapt it.\n\n20. Hire good builders and save money in the long run. Invest in better construction to spend less on maintenance.\n\n21. Adaptation between buildings and users is slow and continuous process that can't be achieved in a single leap.\n\n22. The \"temporary\" is permanent most of the time. If the cheap fix worked, it stays. If it failed, it's embarrassing to remediate.\n\n23. Occupy a building while it's being finished or remodeled. It's worth it for the fine-tuning that your presence affords. Make sure things sit exactly where it feels best for you: counter height, fridge, sinks, etc. It should fit like tailored clothing.\n\n24. Fine-tuning (making little repairs as you go) turns a building into a joy. Find things that don't work and try things that might not work. By failing small, early, and often, it can succeed long and large.\n\n### References\n\n- [How Buildings Learn](https://www.amazon.com/How-Buildings-Learn-Stewart-Brand/dp/0140139966)\n- [The Technium: Construction is Life](https://kk.org/thetechnium/construction-is-life/)\n\n---\n\nImage Credit: **Google’s New Bjarke Ingels and Thomas Heatherwick Designed Headquarters**\n\n\u003cspan className=\"text-sm\"\u003e\n  Google's new Bay View campus, spanning 1.1 million square feet of space at\n  NASA’s Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley.

        '\nThe way I _learned_ to program is basically the opposite of how we _teach_ people programming. The way programming is taught is typically aligned to how computers work, and how a language works - e.g., language constructs and syntax. Something like this:\n\n\u003cspan className="text-base"\u003e\n* Chapter 1: Data Types\n* Chapter 2: Variables\n* Chapter 3: Operators/Math\n* Chapter 4: Control structures\n* Chapter 5: Arrays\n* Chapter 6: Functions\n* Chapter 7: Structs\n* Chapter 8: Classes and Objects\n* Chapter 9: Methods\n* Chapter 10: Inheritance and Polymorphism\n* Chapter 11: Some advanced thing X\n* Chapter 12: Some esoteric thing Y\n* Chapter 13: You think you are so smart - let\'s introduce concurrency!\n\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe way I **learned** programming is by **building** things!  \n\nIt starts with a desire to make something - to create. It begins with a desire to create a website, or an API, or a program that reads tweets and calculates sentiment. To create something, I need skills! The _motivation to learn the skills springs from the desire to create_.\n\nI believe artists learn to paint or sculpt to create something, to express themselves. They want to share something with the world and need a way to bring it to life. I believe the same principle applies to programming.\n\nWhen I want to create something, I ask myself what the best technologies might be to implement the idea. That also involves asking other people smarter and/or more experienced than I am. As an example, for a high-performance API I might choose Go or Rust. For a website I might choose React/JavaScript or Vue.\n\n\u003e ​“The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.” \n\u003e\n\u003e \u003ccite\u003e– Ludwig Wittgenstein, Tractatus logigo-philosphicus\u003c/cite\u003e\n\nIf I don’t already know the language, I will setup a development environment, get the reference material (e.g., “The Go programming Language” by Donovan and Kernigan) and begin. I will read enough to get myself started, I will seek examples of good code on GitHub, I will watch YouTube videos, and if I get stuck, I go back to the reference material. Rarely, if ever, will I read a code language book cover to cover – I tend to use it as reference material only.  \n\nWe know intuitively and backed up by research that humans learn:\n\n* When we are motivated and _want_ to learn\n* We _learn by doing_.  \n\nGo out there and build something! Better yet, do it with a group of people who are learning the same thing. Peer instruction and live coding are amazing ways to learn programming but also all the other things like how to set up your development tools, what programming fonts look best, how to use Git, etc. This is one of the main reasons I love forms of “group” programming – for example pair or mob programming. \n\nWhat are you creating?

        '\n### A Simple Microservice Definition\n\nA microservice is generally defined as a small, loosely coupled, distributed service. Each service is part of a broader microservices ecosystem/architecture, comprising a set of microservices that operate together to solve a common goal. A collection of microservices can be regarded as a system.\n\n### Why use Microservices?\n\nMicroservices architectures were adopted for very specific reasons/needs such as scalability, modularity, or separation of concerns. It shifted the complexity "up the stack" by making the services themselves [potentially] simpler and easier to maintain and scale for the price of more complexity overall.\n\nTeams were given the freedom [in some cases] to choose their own micro-architecture for each microservice. Teams wanted the freedom to be able to pick whatever language, database, and library they desired. For some, this kind of autonomy was energizing. It led to more innovation, faster development time, and shorter release cycles - for a while.\n\nAnother principle of microservices is that the team that built the service supports the service. That is a win early on as the service is being built, because support is non-existent. The team can "move fast and break things". As the service goes into production and matures, the team eventually slows down because now they must support the service and maintain it.\n\n### Challenges with Microservices\n\nSome organizations say microservices allow them to release inter-team friction and break inertia by letting each team operate independently and keep their microservices small and elegant. This is true, but the _overall_ architecture is quite the opposite.\n\nSometimes microservices exist because teams dislike code review, or overbearing ‘architects’ above them telling them what to do. While some people may realize there is nothing smart about this architecture choice for the whole system, many developers are content to care only about their team -- and not the company or application stack as a whole. For them autonomy is more important.\n\n"Doing microservices" became validation for organizations that lack conviction, or a thesis, about how their architecture _should_ be. This ecology of interacting parties, each acting in their own interest for the common good not only sounds utopian, but speaks to an underlying, tacit belief that the emergent mesh of services will approximate the latent natural architecture of the domain. The backlash against microservices is partly because that simply isn\'t true - instead microservices approximate the natural contours of the technology organization\'s **organizational model**, not the domain. This is known as "[Conway\'s law](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway\'s_law)":\n\n\u003e Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization\'s communication structure.\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003ccite\u003e\u0026mdash; Melvin E. Conway\u003c/cite\u003e\n\nClearly one of the reasons why we got here as an industry is we didn’t want to (or couldn\'t) communicate well across teams and organizational structures. Transitioning our computer architectures from well-architected, simpler things into a complex spider web of services is not something we would do intentionally, right?\n\nThe extra complexity to operate microservices requires additional infrastructure. Kubernetes is a popular choice to orchestrate and operate all the various microservices in a system. To complete a task like booking a ride on Uber, one service must request data from potentially dozens of other services — a complex and often problem-prone process, especially as microservices scale. A service mesh becomes necessary for service discovery and securely routing requests from one service to the next. It acts like a switchboard -- it routes requests to the right service.\n\nThe service mesh is a dedicated, configurable infrastructure layer that can document how different parts of a microservices-base system interact. There are a couple of ways of implementing a service mesh, but most often, a sidecar proxy is applied to each microservice as a contact point. (The interactions among the sidecars put the mesh in the service mesh term.) It tends to look like this:\n\n![Mesh](/assets/blog/img/service-mesh-1680.png)\n\n### The Problems in More Detail\n\nIn addition to being harder to operate, microservices are more dfficult to debug. It is a lot easier to debug the interactions between components of a system when they communicate within the same process, especially when one component simply calls a method on another. This is usually just a matter of attaching a debugger to the process, stepping through the method calls and watching variables. There is no straightforward equivalent of this in microservices. Service communications are notoriously difficult to trace and piece together, requiring additional tooling, infrastructure, and complexity.\n\n\u003cYouTube link="https://youtu.be/y8OnoxKotPQ" /\u003e\n\nMicroservices add complexity and leave us with inefficient communications, less error detection in development, easier ways to introduce errors, a worse debugging experience (e.g., relying on searching further through distributed log analysis tools), and require more and more management software to deploy.\n\nInternal web services/APIs are often doubly inefficient by using REST (and having to convert to JSON and back) rather than binary transmissions. If multiple microservices hops are used, this all adds up and slows down the system. A conversion to JSON and back is a wasted effort, more so if done dozens of times.\n\n\u003e “We adopted microservices so every outage could be like a murder mystery.”\n\nFrankly, centralized architecture and standards, when put in the hands of the _wrong_ few could be very counterproductive and feel unfair to everyone else that enjoys software design and doesn’t get to play in the sandbox. This is undeniable. However, isn’t this an argument for smaller teams and less engineering bloat, and better hiring instead?\n\nGood architects and technical leaders can keep code maintainable and ensure it remains modular, enabling efficient future developments. These are **not** things we want to give up.\n\n- If we think about resilient systems, the most resilient systems are the ones with the least number of moving parts. The same is true for the fastest systems.\n\n- If we think about deployment and management and upgrades, the simplest systems to deploy and maintain also have the least number of moving parts.\n\n### Elegant Architecture Recommendations for a More Civilized Age\n\n\u003e “Finding service boundaries is really damn hard…”\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003ccite\u003e\u0026mdash; All microservices architects, ever\u003c/cite\u003e\n\nHence, it is safer to start with larger/wider boundaries - probably the boundaries of proper bounded contexts. This is especially relevant to services encompassing core business domains. Design your architecture layers properly. Organize your teams into the way you want your architectural boundaries to be. Allow for both transactions and events.\n\n- Web requests can be managed by one type of instance, that results in one EC2 image or whatever. Anything that can be handled within the lifecycle of one request can be handled there, and these instances are horizontally scaled behind a load balancer.\n\n- Asynchronous tasks are managed by a service tier, often connected to an event bus. There may be one of these for each programming language, or maybe a few more, and that would be ok. But because these are horizontally scaled and only ask for new jobs when they have free compute resources, one type of instance can contain code for any manner of asynchronous jobs.\n\n- Code that needs to be shared between the asynchronous services and the web tier should be kept in libraries used by both and is not a service call.\n\n- Don\'t use JSON for internal API\'s - consider something like Google\'s protobuf or Apache Thrift to serialize and deserialize data. It\'s fast, it\'s efficient, and enables much better debugging.\n\n#### Benefits\n\n1. Errors are eliminated because they can be caught better at compile time and with unit tests.\n\n2. When changes are made, they can be made in a library, and if the API of a function changes, it is impossible to build/deploy the code until it is fixed.\n\n3. We do not need to keep up to date with the latest in container wrangling software, and using various service discovery, ingress solutions, service meshes, or otherwise. These are problems created by complicated architectures. The service tiers can communicate over an event bus and there is no need to know the address of any server.\n\n---\n\nImage Credit: **Long Distance Operators, Omaha, 1959**\n\n\u003cspan className="text-sm"\u003e\n  Switchboard operators were expected to be courteous, quick-thinking, and\n  patient under pressure.

        '\nLately, everyone seems to want to talk about technology risk. I am not just referring to cybersecurity risks, I am referring to the operational types of risks (those outside your information security program) that could cause a sizable impact to your business. As a CIO for over 20 years, I want to share what keeps me up at night - and how internal technology risk management programs may be improved.\n\nFor this discussion I\'d like to set aside cybersecurity. Yes, it\'s a key concern -- but in most cases, it is well-funded and senior management is well aware of the risks. On the operational side, however, many companies address technology risks indirectly: via controls. Controls are certainly important, and when the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was passed in 2002, it was a major improvement in the way companies viewed technology controls (at least related to financial systems).\n\nWith all the new SOX controls in place did technology risk decrease overall? It may have slightly, but I didn\'t notice it in practice. Controls are very beneficial at reducing some types of technology risk, but they may not be _directly_ addressing some of your biggest risks. \n\n## Controls indirectly reduce technology risk\n\nControls are part of how we think of technology “management” and/or “governance”. Good governance, and good management, are essential. However, control \u0026 management frameworks such as COBIT[^fn1], or service management frameworks such as ITIL[^fn2], don’t reduce all technology risks. Instead, they are focused on “management of the technology function”, not directly on reducing risk.  \n\nFor example, COBIT’s design is based on the following principles:\n\n* Principle 1: Meeting Stakeholder Needs\n* Principle 2: Covering the Enterprise End-to-End\n* Principle 3: Applying a Single Integrated Framework\n* Principle 4: Enabling a Holistic Approach\n* Principle 5: Separating Governance from Management\n \nDo these principles speak directly to managing technology risk? \n\nITIL may do a better job addressing traditional technology risks because a large portion is focused on service delivery, which includes reliability and availability. However, ITIL doesn\'t address overall complexity in your technology environment, overall technology investment levels, sourcing strategy, culture, etc., all of which impact overall technology risk. \n\nControls and control frameworks tend to focus on tangible, measurable activities. For example, you can pass an audit by proving that you have a well-documented (and followed) software development process, even if the process is not very good at delivering what the business needs. The software development process is also a magnet for controls, a convenient framework for regulators, and risk and internal audit personnel to attach an ever-increasing burden of business and technology controls. This inevitably slows software development to a crawl. A burden that digital companies had to shed to speed up delivery -- along came Agile development. \n\nIt is important to point out that controls add cost but do not _automatically_ reduce risk. Some technology controls add cost, or time, without an offsetting benefit.  Sometimes controls are ineffective, poorly designed, or implemented poorly -- adding delay, cost, and taking away from higher value work.\n\nWhen I think of technology risk, and what keeps me up at night, I don’t immediately jump to weak “controls”. \n\n## What directly drives technology risk?\n\nThese are the things that keep me up at night. These areas of technology risk (outside of cyber risk) that I believe drive your largest technology risks. I think in terms of broad areas of technology risk that could _manifest with direct impact to your bottom line_. \n\n* **Culture**: Companies with a strong culture of accountability and ownership experience less technology risk. Yes, that\'s obvious, but how do you measure and foster that type of culture? Culture is so multi-faceted that it requires whole [discussion of its own](/posts/2021-08-12-culture-measure-what-you-treasure), however in this context we are mainly speaking to accountability. Those people in an organization that see their mission as keeping a specific system (or set of technologies) operational and secure at all times. Can you name the "system owners" of all your key systems? When you name them would they agree with you? Do they have the support and resources they require? Do you have a culture of clear accountibility? If not, your systems will be less reliable and secure - simple as that. \n\n* **Complexity**: Imagine having a system comprised of one single component that works 99% of the time. System availability = 99%.  Now imagine the system is made up of 100 components, all with 99% reliability. If we raise 0.99 to the hundredth power (0.99 x 0.99 x  0.99 x 0.99 …) we end up with .366, or just _37% overall availability_. If we think about resilient systems, the most resilient systems are the ones with the least number of moving parts. Complexity is also the enemy of security. Hackers “attack the seams.” A properly managed, patched, and configured server is very difficult to attack. Professional hackers look for the seams -- the places where people and processes are imperfect, and something is left exposed. The more complex your infrastructure and systems, the more likely it is to have "seams" with exposed vulnerabilities. Anti-complexity is the main driver of security, reliability, and availability. How do we measure our complexity? Is it increasing or decreasing?\n\n* **Black Swans**: Nearly all major outages I have seen in my career have been due to some “unique confluence of factors”. The post incident review always says something to the effect of “we never thought about, or anticipated, this ever occurring”. AWS "[Post-Event Summaries](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/pes/)" are fun to read because they are masterful at implying that without ever directly stating it. Nearly all risk management programs focus on reducing the risks we know or have experienced before. Humans simply can\'t anticipate black swans very well. The main thing that reduces black swans is **reducing complexity** (above).  \n\n* **Change**: Not “change control” but rather the _overall amount and magnitude of change_ occurring in your technology environment in any given period.  This can be measured by the number and magnitude of projects, plus the volume of items sent through the change management process.  What is our “change vector”? Most day-to-day outages are "self-inflicted wounds". One company I am familiar with let many of their network engineers go during a re-organization. That meant no one was making any changes to the network, and for a while it was more stable than it had ever been. Have you ever heard the saying that technology changes at the speed of Moore’s law? Well, humans change at the speed of Darwin’s law. Can your people cope with all the change? \n\n* **Zombie Projects**: You know what really puts an organization at risk?  The zombie projects that live in plain sight. Zombies are projects that, for any number of reasons, fail to fulfill their promise and yet keep shuffling along, sucking up resources without any real hope of having a meaningful impact on the company’s strategy or revenue prospects. Many zombies are top executive pet projects, and most companies reward systems carry strong penalties for failing to meet commitments, so naturally people hesitate to raise their hands and say: “Our project is one of those.” It just looks smarter to find ways to stay alive. I personally have seen _single zombie projects cost between 10 and 40 million dollars_. Projects, particularly related to innovation, should be funded using a "venture capital" model. Seed the project, and if it shows promise, continue subsequent "investments" in the project as it shows measurable benefits. If not, stop future funding.\n\n* **Technology Supply Chain**: Recently, during the pandemic companies couldn\'t even procure basic items like laptops and monitors, or even printer toner, due to supply chain issues. Suppliers are a key risk to your business. For example, in February 2022 Toyota stopped production in Japan, which accounts for about a third of its global production, after a key supplier was hit by a cyber-attack. Toyota is well-known for implementing Just-In-Time manufacturing -- parts that arrive from suppliers going straight to the production line rather than being stockpiled. Toyota is a highly efficient manufacturer, but one that is also more exposed to supply chain risk and disruption. Primary targets are getting very good at preventing direct cyber-attacks; suppliers are often overlooked as an attack vector. With more and more technology work being sourced from numerous suppliers any of these risks could be a major source of disruption:\n\n  - Third party service providers, from janitorial services to software engineering, with physical or virtual access to information systems, software code, or IP.\n  - Poor information security practices by any of your suppliers.\n  - Compromised software or hardware purchased from suppliers.\n\n* **End-of-Life Technology**: Companies are much better at introducing new technologies than retiring them. The cost of running unsupported technology is higher than you think. Companies that don’t pay attention to deployed technology reaching obsolescence face a higher number of security risks and vulnerabilities than companies that keep a close eye on the lifecycle of elements in their IT landscape. With end-of-life of technology, technology management must deal with challenges such as integration issues, limited functionality, low service levels, lack of available skills, and missing support from vendors. Often, I see internally supported software that uses outdated technology and programming languages, which mean the people supporting the system no longer have market-appropriate skills -- and you can’t hire for those skills. What is the count of systems that you retired in 2021?\n\n* **Orphan technologies**: Companies today have way more systems and software titles than they have technology employees. That means ensuring that the technology is being managed properly is a challenge. Does every piece of software or hardware in your environment have a clear owner? Does the owner have the time, focus and resources to maintain what they own?  If not, they are orphans. Orphans expose you to technlogy risks. Did you pare down your orphan systems in 2021?\n\n* **Business continuity**: Strong business continuity programs reduce risk in obvious ways, but also in non-obvious ways. A great business continuity program can help insulate you from some of the risks listed here. Other non-obvious ways include the need to understand and catalog _your most critical systems_, understand how they operate, and consider what new threats exist (such as ransomware). The difficulty of validating your business continuity plan keeps increasing along with complexity. Sometimes you can\'t validate business continuity directly -- you must trust your vendors and partners. With SaaS, availability is specified in the contract -- if one of your critical systems is SaaS-based how do you really know how well the vendor has addressed business continuity?\n\n* **Sourcing**.  Sourcing can save you money (reduced labor costs), or cost you money (longer time to deliver, errors, omissions, etc.). If your savings and costs are all internal eventually the right balance will be achieved. However, liability is an area that is difficult, if not impossible to outsource. If an error in your software _exposes your organization to liability, then you must consider reputational damage as well_. Cybersecurity reputational damage has decreased over time (some now see it as almost as a cost of doing business), but sourcing is seen purely as a management decision. See: [Boeing\'s 737 Max Software Outsourced to $9-an-Hour Engineers](https://www.industryweek.com/supply-chain/article/22027840/boeings-737-max-software-outsourced-to-9anhour-engineers).\n\n* **Adequate funding**: Organizations that do not view technology as strategic, an/or seek to minimize cost in the technology function will suffer less reliable technology and more technology risk. This is clear and unambiguous. However, the inverse is not as clear -- organizations that are adequately funded can also experience less reliable technology depending on _how the money is spent_. If it\'s not spent addressing the items above, then you probably will spend it on "realized risks".\n \n## Summary\n\nIf you want to reduce technology risk you must be able to measure and reason about the factors that actually drive your largest, critical technology risks. This is a good starting point to think about technology risks that may fall outside of control frameworks. Is your internal technology risk management function measuring these factors? \n\n#### References\n\n- [HBR: Zombie Projects: How to Find Them and Kill Them](https://hbr.org/2015/03/zombie-projects-how-to-find-them-and-kill-them)\n- [Boeing\'s 737 Max Software Outsourced to $9-an-Hour Engineers](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-28/boeing-s-737-max-software-outsourced-to-9-an-hour-engineers)\n- [AWS Post-Event Summaries](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/pes/)\n- [Toyota stops production in Japan after a cyberattack hits one of its suppliers](https://www.npr.org/2022/02/28/1083550554/toyota-stops-production-in-japan-after-a-cyberattack-hits-one-of-its-suppliers)\n\n#### Footnotes\n\n[^fn1]: COBIT is the acronym for Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies.

        '\nMost company values are just a bunch of undifferentiated _nice things_, nearly always some combination of these ten:\n\n\u003cspan className="text-base"\u003e\n1.  Integrity. \n2.  Honesty. \n3.  Fairness.\n5.  Accountability. \n6.  Promise to Customers.\n7.  Diversity and Inclusion.\n8.  Learning.\n9.  Teamwork.\n10.  Passion.\n11.  Quality.\n\u003c/span\u003e\n\nThe basic concept is that if we’re aligned on a set of values, then we can trust each other to make decisions that "fit" our culture and values. They will help us hire colleagues who are aligned to our values. Values will boost morale. \n\n\u003e"It\'s not hard to make decisions once you know what your values are."\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003ccite\u003e\u0026mdash; Roy E. Disney\u003c/cite\u003e\n\nWhich company _wouldn’t_ say they want to focus on honesty, teamwork, or passion? Do the words guide employee behavior or decisions? Do these words specify exactly behaviors we expect, or how we want our or employees to act? Do they tell us what the company stands for, or believes in? Do they tell us how to "walk the tightrope" and make appropriate tradeoffs? \n\n## Good - Values Must be Verbs\n\nDo _you_ use your company\'s values consistently when making decisions? Do you even remember your company’s values?\n\nIn order to breathe context and life into our values and beliefs, we need to be able to use them as verbs. So, the first thing we need to do to make them actionable and real is to translate them into verbs.  \n\n\u003e"For values or guiding principles to be truly effective they have to be verbs. It’s not “integrity,” it’s “always do the right thing.” It’s not “innovation,” it’s “look at the problem from a different angle.” Articulating our values as verbs gives us a clear idea... we have a clear idea of how to act in any situation. We can hold each other accountable to measure them or even build incentives around them. Telling people to have integrity doesn’t guarantee that their decisions will always keep customers’ or clients’ best interests in mind; telling them to always do the right thing does."\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003ccite\u003e\u0026mdash; Simon Sinek, "Start with Why"\u003c/cite\u003e\n\n### Examples\n\n* Instead of **courage** say: “_We question actions inconsistent with our values._”\n* Instead **integrity** say: “_We only say things about fellow employees directly to them._”\n* Instead of **openness** say: "_We say what we think, even if it is uncomfortable._"\n\nThese examples are starting to show what living our values looks like. However, we can do even better. We often naturally think of choices in terms of "yes or no". For example: "Do I want to go out for dinner tonight?" The real choice is "**where** do I want to go for dinner?" Decisions and actions are about making tradeoffs.  \n\n## Better - Values Specify Tradeoffs\n\nOur time and resources are finite - saying "yes" to one option is saying "no" to other possible options. It\'s very hard to make choices when it requires you to discriminate among many good options. It\'s even worse if your values make your employees feel they are impossible to live up to, or that they are trapped - that they must somehow be "fast", "cheap", **and** "perfect".\n\nFor values to be truly useful they must specify the tradeoffs we should make.  Nearly every decision we are asked to make every single day involves deciding what is most important to us and where we must compromise. Deciding what college to attend, car to buy, company to work for, candidate to elect—ultimately comes down to "even/over" decisions. Making these hard choices ultimately yields one consistent result: stress. \n\nWhat can we tell our employees about our values that helps them understand our culture make the right decisions (and remove stress)?  The most well-known example is Facebook\'s motto: \n\n\u003e"Move fast _and break things_." \n\nIt’s not just “move fast”. Who doesn’t want to move fast? Instead, it\'s "move fast _and break things_".  \n\nWhy give explicit permission to break things? Engineers at large internet organizations who are responsible for operating an organization\'s web presence abhor change. In order to keep operational stability they view making changes to systems like most of us view juggling chain saws - fun to watch someone else do it, but when it goes wrong it goes **dreadfully** wrong. \n\nThis value communicates perfectly that Facebook valued speed **even/over** stability and quality.  It was meant to tell the engineers it was OK if the systems had some instability if that meant speed of delivery was improved.  **That is a clear tradeoff that allows for autonomous decisions - exactly what we want.**\n\nNordstrom is another great example.  They state what they are about right in their mission statement:\n\n\u003e"Our mission is to continue our dedication to providing a unique range of products, **exceptional customer service, and great experiences.**”\n\nIf I created a value statement for Nordstrom it might be "We take care of our customers, even/over taking care of our ourselves."  I used to exclusively shop at Nordstrom\'s because I had the sense that if I ever had any problems **they would be resolved in my favor.**\n\nFinally, let\'s take one more example from Netflix:\n\n\u003e"We’re a team, not a family; We’re like a pro sports team, not a kid’s recreational team."\n\t\nA friend said "I\'d never want to work for Netflix after reading that." Another friend said "that\'s awesome they are so honest and upfront". This is a signal that Netflix phrased their values well. A good values statement should polarize. It should attract the right people and repel people whose core values don\'t align.  \n\nRemember, if we tell our employees we value "quality _and_ speed" it\'s pointless.  It\'s going to get a well-deserved eye-roll.  However, if we tell our employees we value "quality even/over speed" now we have provided clear guidance about our values and enabled our employees to make appropriate choices. We will also attract the right people who value quality.  \n\n### Example\n\nLet\'s assume our company has a value called "Fairness". First, let\'s make our value a verb. Instead of just "fairness" how about: \n\n\u003e"Always treat our customers and our employees equally and fairly."\n\nGood.  But we can do much better - let\'s specify the tradeoffs we expect:\n\n\u003e"Always treat our customers and employees equally and fairly, even if that means we cannot satisfy some of our most demanding customers."\n\nOur value is now clear. It will serve as a guide for our culture and enable our employees to operate independently and make decisions aligned with our concept of fairness. \n\n## Best - Beliefs, not Values\n\nI believe a company should not have core values. Instead, I believe "core beliefs" are better and far more powerful. \n\nMartin Luther King inspired change in a country where many people didn\'t want to change. In his famous speech he told us his core beliefs and where they could take us. He said "I believe..." and "I have a dream.."  If your beliefs aligned with his you felt inspired. His dreams became your dreams. Shared beliefs were the "fuel" that inspired us to act. \n\nCore beliefs begin with "I believe" or "We believe". Let\'s re-craft Facebook\'s "move fast and break things" as a belief:\n\n\u003e"We believe we are the most powerful social media platform on earth. However, our competitors have access to the same technology and talent that we do, and they move quickly. As we grow we must keep our ability to move fast to continue to lead our industry. So, move fast and break things!"\n\nHow about Netflix:\n\n\u003e"We believe business is a contact sport. There are winners and losers. Only the winners reap the rewards, and we believe in winning. We compete hard. We’re a team, not a family; We’re like a pro sports team, not a kid’s recreational team. We are laser-focused on winning."\n\nGet the idea?  See how powerful beliefs can be?\n\n---\n\n### Coda\n\nThe words "incision" and "decision" have the same Latin root; the verb **incīdere**, meaning “to carve” or “to cut into.”  So, a decision is when you “cut away” the other options and commit to the one you’ve left intact.\n\nIn logic and philosophy, a **razor** is a rule of thumb that you can use to “cut” weaker lines of reasoning — which can help you to make wiser judgments and cleaner decisions, quickly.\n\nMost of us have heard of Occam\'s razor:\n\n\u003eWhen confronted with equally plausible lines of reasoning, favor the one which makes fewer assumptions.\n\nThe concept in decision-making of a "razor" is a principle or guideline that is worded specifically enough to clearly slice up a set of options into whether they fit or not. **Your beliefs and values must be the "razors" that guide your decisions.**  ',

        '\nIn 2015 Bloomberg [installed a framed New Yorker cartoon](https://wwd.com/business-news/media/bloomberg-new-yorker-cartoon-kaamran-hafeez-conference-rooms-10270074-10270074/) in every conference room in its New York headquarters that reads: “I know we didn’t accomplish anything, but that’s what meetings are for.”\n\nI personally own a framed copy.  \n\nBloomberg employees said at the time there were so many meetings it was impossible to book a conference room in the building. Some concluded that Michael Bloomberg had the cartoons placed in the conference rooms to “discourage pointless meetings.”\n\n### Should We Discourage Meetings?\n\nThere are often too many people invited, for too long of a time, covering too little content, with too little accountability. So, yes we should discourage at least some meetings. We also must be curious what is driving meetings.\n\nStudy the cadence, topics, and invite lists of meetings. Too often, meetings are maladapted attempts to solve problems. So if you want to know what parts of the organization are suffering the most, pay attention to what the teams are having meetings about, how often meetings are held, and who is being dragged into those meetings. In particular, look for meetings with long invite lists. Large meetings are much less effective than small meetings, but they do convincingly spread the blame around by giving everyone the impression that all parties were consulted and all opinions were explored. Meetings with ever-expanding invite lists suggest something is very wrong somewhere. \n\n- **Meetings are band-aids**. Too often, meetings are the only way things get done within a company. Without meetings, people don’t know what to do, how to do it, and are afraid to act. It creates limited forward progress, and yet, they are needed because **some** progress is better than **none**. Many organizations use meetings to gain consensus and push things along because otherwise nothing might happen. It a laborious, inefficient solution to a systemic problem. Ideally, people would know their organization/department mission and priorities, collaborate asynchronously, know where to find information and resources, innovate, make mistakes, and organically course-correct within a culture of trust and growth. Sadly, that is so rare it\'s almost impossible to find.\n\n- **Right intentions, wrong format**. A lot of the time, meeting-heavy work culture stems from good intentions. In the spirit of transparency and inclusion, teammates add meetings to the calendar to bring folks along and ensure everyone has context. Inclusion and transparency are foundational to great teamwork, but back-to-back meetings are not the **only** way to get there.\n\n- **Too many passive observers**. A favorite term of mine is "meeting tourists". Have you ever known people who somehow get invited to every meeting but hardly ever speak?  As Harvard Business Review reported back in 2019, **most** meeting attendees are passive participants -- they just come to listen and observe. Many of them are also doing other work during the meeting - a sure sign they shouldn\'t be there.\n\n- **Meetings are often a waste of money**. If I spend $60 taking one of our employees for lunch, to be reimbursed I have to upload the receipt, explain where and when the lunch occurred, the purpose, the number of people in attendance, and then my supervisor has to approve it. **For $60 dollars!** If I call an hour meeting with 12 people, and to make the math easy let\'s say their time is worth $100 per hour, I have just "spent" $1,200 dollars with zero accountability. Imagine if you had to create a purchase order for $1,200 dollars to "buy" the meeting!\n\n- **Meetings are often poorly run**. Some people are better than others, but some meetings have no agenda, no facilitation, no clear purpose, no notes or meeting minutes, etc. At the very least meetings should have a clearly stated purpose: "We are meeting today to decide on... something."\n\n  \u003e "Between depriving a man of one hour from his life and depriving him of his life there exists only a difference of degree."\n  \u003e\n  \u003e \u003ccite\u003e\u0026mdash; Frank Herbert, Dune Messiah\u003c/cite\u003e\n\n- **Meetings are political**. Some companies are very hierarchical - they must invite "all the bosses" to meetings. Bosses who then cascade the material to their managers, who in turn cascade it further down. Anyone who has played the telephone game knows how poorly this can go. Or, people seek to attend certain meetings just to reinforce their level or stature in the company, not because of the content. Or, consider the dynamics when a powerful individual joins a meeting with junior colleagues, the junior colleagues are often swayed by the power of the senior, or are afraid to truly engage if they disagree.\n\n### How to Discourage Meetings (by Building an Asynchronous Culture)\n\n1. **Ask if people found the meeting valuable!**\n\n   If you believe a meeting is critical, validate your belief with data. Close it with a "stoplight review." Ask everyone if they felt the meeting was a valuable use of their time. They can respond immediately with one of the three below:\n\n   * **Green** ("Yes, and please include me in meetings like this in the future.")\n   * **Yellow**  ("Parts of it were helpful, but communicate core messages other ways if possible." OR "I\'m just not sure.")\n   * **Red** ("Not worth it; cut these meetings in the future.")\n\n1. **Rely less on meetings and more on trust**\n\n   People want to feel that they have autonomy on the job, and excessive check-ins may give them the impression they’re under surveillance. Teams that are given more freedom will in turn be less dependent on their leadership, giving them space to develop their own creativity, resilience, and problem-solving skills.\n\n   The point here is that managers need to take a leap of faith. Ask yourself honestly: Where could you be less hands-on when it comes to deliverables? If you’re struggling to give certain employees more independence, why is that? It might be a red flag that something is wrong in your relationship with your staff, or that their work isn’t up to scratch.\n\n   Rather than fall back on meetings, see if this is a chance to give your employees more educational opportunities. Using performance data, you can easily identify who needs assistance in what areas and offer them corresponding training materials. With such data, employees don’t have to feel shy about asking for extra support, and managers can foster a closer informal relationship with the team.\n   \n2. **Rely less on meetings and more on data**\n\n   Data is unbiased, accurate, and insightful in a way that humans can’t be (especially after the fifth meeting of the day). It can help managers better understand how teams are working, how projects are progressing, and even how employees are feeling — boosting overall trust and work quality. Data can be the deciding factor in finally getting rid of useless meetings.\n\n   Meetings aren’t always an accurate or even truthful reflection of the work that’s being done. Employees can only provide a subjective measurement of their progress — and they typically under or overestimate their performance. We’re only human. Different personality types can also send misleading messages: Someone who appears unengaged or uninterested may be one of your most productive employees.\n\n   Then there’s the risk of meetings being merely transactional, where team members autopilot their updates (and repeat the work that’s already being done by project management tools), or simply tell managers what they want to hear.\n\n   Data gives a more in-depth look at employees’ productivity, objectively telling you most of what you need to know about their progress, quality, and output.\n\n   Analytics platforms such as [ActivTrak](https://www.activtrak.com/), [Timely](https://memory.ai/timely), and [ZeroedIn](https://www.zeroedin.com/) integrate with a wide range of teams’ project management tools, codebase, and more to document employee performance in real time, and to automate reporting rather than relying on information shared in meetings. Managers can turn to data around priority metrics (e.g., the number of completed tickets or projects finished within budget) to review team or individual productivity without interrupting employees’ workflow.\n\n3. **Rely less on synchronous communications and more on asynchronous collaboration**\n\n   Async communication happens in writing, instead of in-person. It’s a great way to keep teams in sync without having to meet in-person, or over video. It also has the added benefit of improving access to information and creating a written record of all your team’s progress and accomplishments.\n\n   Async communication works really well for meetings like standups and status updates. But it can also be used to replace or shorten many other meetings on your team’s calendars too. Examples:\n\n   - **Status updates**: Rather than holding a daily or weekly round-robin, teams use async written updates (like check-ins) to share progress on in-flight work and flag blockers. This eliminates a meeting that can sometimes feel repetitive and helps folks more easily surface context about the work that they wouldn’t have had time for in a 30-second update. Template:\n\n      - Status check: What’s the status of this project? How have you moved it forward since your last check-in?\n      - Blocked: Is there anything you’re blocked on?\n      - FYI: Is there anything the team needs to be aware of?\n\n   - **Standups**: For async standups, teams use daily written updates to share what they’re working on, what they’ve accomplished, and how they’re doing. Not only does this cut down on the number of hours spent in meetings each week, but it also gives folks a line of sight into how everyone’s doing so they can collaborate and support each other.  Template:\n\n      - Plan: What are you working on today? Share your top 1-3 priorities.\n      - Progress: How have you moved work forward since we last checked in?\n      - Blocked: What are you blocked on?\n      - Mood: How are you feeling today?\n\n   - **Team meetings**: Adding an async pre-read component can help folks align before the team meeting and come prepared. This ensures a more productive discussion and can often help cut down the meeting’s length. Template:\n\n      - Weekly focus: What’s your primary focus this week?\n      - FYI: Is there anything the team needs to be aware of?\n      - Team-building: Rotate in a different team-building question each week to get to know each other and spark discussion.\n      - Celebrate: What’s something or someone to celebrate this week?\n\n   - **1:1s**: Instead of meetings centered around status updates, consider using async check-ins or even email to share updates. Then you can use your meeting time to chat about personal development or how you’re feeling. Template:\n\n      - Mood: How are you doing this week?\n      - Accomplishment: What are you most proud of this week?\n      - Learning: What did you learn this week?\n      - Blocked: Is there anything you’re blocked on?\n\n### Coda\n\n\u003e "Time is the coin of your life.

        '\nEric Ries, who introduced the concept of the minimum viable product as part of his [Lean Startup](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0307887898?tag=lessolearn01-20\u0026camp=213381\u0026creative=390973\u0026linkCode=as4\u0026creativeASIN=0307887898\u0026adid=004DZWTQ0HQTRCNYZJPD) methodology, describes the purpose of a "minimum viable product", or MVP, this way:\n\n\u003e It is the version of a new product that allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least amount of effort.\n\nA MVP is a product with enough features to attract early-adopter customers and validate a product idea early in the product development cycle. The MVP helps the product team receive user feedback as quickly as possible to iterate and improve the product.\n\nBecause the agile methodology is built on validating and iterating products based on user input, the concept of an MVP plays a central role in agile development. When building a new product, we all know we should remain agile and launch something small and simple to start. Then over time, we can improve the product by adding more features over time, as previous features prove their value.\n\nMost importantly, an MVP allows your company to _minimize the time and resources_ (the cost) you might otherwise commit to building a product that won’t succeed.\n\n### Today, there are better ways to learn\n\nThe reason behind implementing an MVP had been to tackle the main issue of learning. It was _the minimum cost necessary to learn_. The first danger is the old(er) ways are no longer the least expensive.\n\nWe simply have better tools for this today. You can learn much earlier, faster, and cheaper — without engineering lifting a finger. Prototyping and design sharing tools such as [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/), [Marvel](https://marvelapp.com/), [Figma](https://www.figma.com/prototyping/) and more allow designers and Product Managers to concept, learn, and iterate with user tests. While initial iterations in your prototyping can be minimally viable, a finished product should not.\n\nImagine initial product launches as "first dates" with your potential customers: Do you really want their first impression to be — _“I had a minimally viable time”_?\n\n### When an MVP can become dangerous\n\nUnfortunately, the same process wreaks havoc when it comes to modernizing an existing system. At first, the reason why is not intuitive. In theory, the same principles should apply: Start with small and simple use cases and then build upon your success.\n\nThe difference between product development and software modernization is the **hypothesis you need to prove**.\n\n1. Product development: You’re trying to prove that _customers are willing to pay for the product_. You are seeking "product/market fit".\n\n2. System modernization: People are already using the system. The system is "feature complete" and has been tailored and tweaked over many years. Legacy systems are, after all, successful systems. Instead, the hypothesis we’re trying to prove when we’re modernizing a system is that _the updated technology will do a better job than the technology we’re leaving behind_.\n\n#### Reasons why that might not be the case\n\nModernizing systems that are in heavy use is difficult. When designing an MVP for a modernization effort several issues become apparent:\n\n1. The use cases that seem like the simplest and the most likely to be identified as MVPs are also the parts of the system that no one cares about. We don’t modernize parts of systems that aren’t being used. We should turn them off.\n\n2. Putting the least important set of functionality on a new technology violates the spirit of an MVP. It does not validate that the modernization effort adds value, nor does it "prove" the new technology being used is better than the old one.\n\n3. Defining doing a "better job" than the old software is surprisingly difficult. Things like "it will be easier/cheaper to maintain", or "we will be able to implement change faster" are hard things to measure - and may not be true once the new system reaches the same level of complexity and integration as the old system.\n\n4. No one really understands all the complexity embodied in a legacy system - no one person knows how it all works. When a process is automated, the highly skilled people who designed and built the system disappear because their knowledge becomes embodied in the software. Long term maintenance and enhancements means the system is being used in ways not initially considered or designed for, and other processes and systems become intertwined and integrated. This complexity is **exactly** why existing systems are hard to change. Proving a new system via an MVP doesn\'t make sense unless it shows exactly **how** the new system will meet these challenges.\n\n#### When Validating Migration, Raise the Stakes\n\nThe beginning of a modernization effort is a precious period, so don’t waste it. This is the time when the team has the most excitement, the most momentum, the greatest level of stakeholder buy-in and the most money and staff. When people conflate minimum with simple, they squander a critical stage of the effort.\n\nIt\'s far better to begin migrations with the harder parts of the system. It’s a more challenging project, yes — but the hard bits won’t be any easier months or years later. When you successfully migrate a hard part of the system, you’ve proven that the modernization itself can add value in the same way a MVP validates the effort of building something new.\n\nConquering a hard part of the system also tends to inspire stakeholders, especially if other modernization efforts have failed in the past. Sometimes this enthusiasm takes the form of increased moral support for the team, but it can also lead to more resources and more favorable prioritization.\n\n### MVP\'s also need to prove architectural principles\n\nAll too often MVP\'s ignore basic architectural requirements in the interest of "low cost" and "speed". If the list below isn\'t addressed during the MVP development \u0026 learning process you will have issues in the future. Those issues could be large enough to derail the whole effort. \n\n* **Security** — basic security requirements need to be taken into account for the MVP. These requirements must be able to support a "production-quality" app in the future. Today, security is a core part of the user experience.\n* **Monitoring** — every application should provide monitoring capabilities to monitor performance and system issues. This is tablestakes for a production app, but also super important to learn about the operating qualities and failure states of the MVP.\n* **Platform** — The MVP should run an the same platform that would be used production. It\'s a mistake to build something "in house" and then try to move it to a commercial cloud platform (or vice versa).\n* **Latency and responsiveness** — we shouldn\'t have immediate concerns about latency and responsiveness, since the MVP deployment will be limited to a small user base, but we do need to learn what is acceptable to the users. Latency/responsivness metrics must be included as part of the basic monitoring capabilities.\n* **Scalability** — not usually a concern at first but the architecture of the MVP must provide a scalability path to maintain the latency and responsiveness defined above. \n* **Data Persistency** — some MVPs start with a "toy" database, or data persistency model that must be completely replaced for the "real" application to be properly developed. In some cases this makes sense but if possible build the MVP on the right data persistency platform from the start. \n\n### The Takeaway\n\nMVPs are useful because they validate that a project is worth doing before we\'ve wasted too much time and money. A system modernization project hasn\'t proven its value until it has successfully migrated the important (read: _hard_) parts. For that reason, the right MVP for a modernization effort is often a complex part of the system.\n\nIf you pick an easier part, or don\'t address basic architectural requirements, you will waste time, money, and maybe political capital doing work that _does not prove that this new technology can be trusted with your most critical business functions_. This turns deadly if the project fails months or years later, after millions of dollars have been spent, all because the "MVP" didn\'t prove the right hypothesis at the start.\n\n#### References\n\n- [Why MVP\'s Suck](https://medium.com/@rachklausner/why-mvps-suck-ad06b9866ee7)\n- [Why MVPs Suck: Create Sustainable Optimal Viable Products](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-mvps-suck-create-sustainable-optimal-viable-products-tim-b-green/)\n- [I hate MVPs, so do your customers...](https://blog.asmartbear.com/slc.html)\n\n---\n\nImage Credit: **Sammy Sosa, 1998**\n\n\u003cspan className="text-sm"\u003e\nPersonally, I will argue this one with Cub fans until I die.

        '\nOne of the worst cognitive biases which humans suffer from is the belief that observations about individual people can be generalized. How much faulty thinking, including racism and sexism, stems from this simple error? An extension of this common mistake is thinking of people as interchangeable, or fungible, when planning work - pretending **who** does the work doesn’t matter.\n\n_Individuals matter._\n\nA pattern I\'ve repeatedly seen is companies will plan out the next few quarters of work and then assign some number of people, one person for one quarter to a project, two people for three quarters to another, etc. This process enables executives to make decisions about costs, priorities and project funding. This works for it\'s purpose, however, the roadmap creation and review process perpetuates the fiction that people are interchangeable, that people can be generically abstracted over.\n\nWhen the rubber meets the road, and it\'s time to start a critical project suddenly the people who are assigned to the project become very, very important. When work is about to begin on a specific project, the first questions asked are "**Who** is going to lead it? **Who** is going work on it?". We all know intuitively that the people who ultimately get staffed on the project make an enormous difference on the odds of success.\n\nOne of the primary jobs of managers at all levels is to plan and then execute in accordance with the plan. Good managers know which people get stuff done and how long something should take. Good managers can even adjust estimates based on individual productivity. This is how you build highly accurate plans – _you must plan with the specific people in mind who will be doing the work_. Only a direct line manager can do this, anyone else won’t have the knowledge of each person’s capabilities.\n\n### An Early Lesson Why Individuals Matter\n\nA senior engineer had built a rather complicated system and was intimately familiar with all aspects of it. Whenever he estimated work for that system, he estimated it as if **he were doing the work**. In other words, how long would it take _him_ to develop “X feature”? His estimates came with all the discovery work already done, and they were **very** accurate.\n\nOne day a manager proceeded to take an estimate from this person and assign it to a brand-new hire. When it was almost due, the brand-new engineer said something like "It\'s not done yet. I\'m not really sure how long it will take, but I am learning a ton of cool stuff!" Needless to say, it could have gone better for me.\n\nLater, when I was asked to estimate work the first question I would ask was “who is going to do it?”. Project managers were often surprised by the question, and frequently told me “It doesn’t matter”, as if we are all supposed to pretend that all people are equivalent.\n\nImagine if you wrote a novel and then decided you wanted your friend to write the final chapter, how long would it take them? How well would it turn out? They’d have to learn the premise of book first, right? Or maybe you’d give them an outline as a starting point? The end product might be better or worse than what you would have written, but even if they were brilliant they would take longer. Not that much different from programming really.\n\nOne of the more successful organizations I have had the pleasure of leading had a completely different approach - every estimate explicitly assumed a specific person handles it. Sometimes there were even variations given – e.g., several estimates for the same task depending on who it gets assigned to. No one ever found this odd. It was assumed it was obvious that different people have different skills and familiarity with different technologies or parts of the project.\n\n_Individuals matter_.\n\n### Job Complexity Matters\n\nIf I have a job that only requires picking up rocks and placing them in a bucket, one could argue that “anyone could do it”, which is generally true. However even with unskilled labor there are considerable differences in output. How strong am I? How much stamina do I have? Even in this absurd example individual performance matters.\n\nAs we progress from “lifts rocks” to “performs brain surgery” the capability, knowledge, and skill of the specific individual increasingly matters. Hopefully none of us would choose a doctor by random selection using the mental model that they are “all the same”. \n\nTechnology jobs have progressed much like medicine – as technology has become more and more complex, jobs have become increasingly specialized. Increasing specialization, coupled with business knowledge tends to make individuals highly specialized (and really important to your company).\n\nThe more complexity in your business, and the more unique your business is, the more individuals matter.\n\n### The Type of Work Matters\n\nSome tasks (or projects) just don\'t motivate me at all. Others are interesting and I have a hard time logging out at the end of the day. I think there\'s easily a 3x difference in my own personal performance between those. Could be more. What is your productivity difference when you work on something you are excited about and believe in vs. something you think is a waste of your time?\n\nIn addition to motivation there is skills alignment – this leads to the concept of the “10x” engineer. E.g. the rock star who is ten times as productive as the average engineer. Whether you believe in this idea or not, we can agree that some people are significantly more productive - and yet hiring for that trait is nearly impossible.\n\nWhy? Because they are only productive _after_ they learn your systems, technology, and business practices. In other words, _no one comes in the door as a 10x engineer_. On the other hand, you can develop people into 10x engineers. This suggests that taking steps to _retain_ highly effective engineers (by not ignoring the evidence that they are not fungible) is what is most important.\n\nThe other factor is engineers are usually only “10x” in narrow, specialized technology areas that they know well. If you move them to another team, using different technology and supporting a different business process they quickly revert to being average (at least until they come up to speed again). In other words, if we asked Lebron James to play soccer (play with his feet and not his hands) he might be far below average (and remain there).\n\nMatching the right individual to the right work matters.\n\n### Our Bias Complements our Desire for Simplicity\n\nWhen you have a complex system, for example a company with thousands of people, the system is too complex for any decision maker to really understand. Organizations are like fractals – the more you zoom in the more complexity you perceive/see.\n\nOne way to address this problem is by reducing the perceived complexity of the problem by simplifying the picture of the organization by creating organizational structure - groupings of people. For example, “business units”, “departments”, “subsidiaries”, “divisions”, etc. and imagining that people inside are fungible.\n\nUnlike trying to understand the true complexity of the organization this structure is easier to grasp, it\'s scalable, and if there\'s one thing that companies like, it\'s doing things that scale. Large organizations also scale by tracking and managing “headcount” - and one of the ways to view people as fungible is budgeting in terms of headcount. The company, of course, spends money on specific people with specific skills, and not "heads".\n\nThere\'s no way to convert that into "two more effective and better-paid heads" because recognizing that everyone is different isn’t a scalable model. If you hire two rock-star staff engineers instead of three average "heads", the third "head", and the associated budget, will eventually get moved somewhere else.\n\nThe other main reason is organizations must be able to plan, at least at a macro level. Every team I have ever worked with hates planning; every team hates their methodology and thinks it’s senseless and inaccurate and why are those senior people insisting on a date? It’ll be done when it’s done.\n\nOn the other hand, business leaders often **must** plan around dates – e.g. “should we spend $50k announcing at conference Y next month, or should we wait?” “Our competition just launched; will we be able to launch this quarter (the board wants to know, and we have to report material financial impact items quarterly or face SEC fines)?”\n\nPlanning is absolutely necessary, and as noted earlier, one of the primary jobs of managers at all levels is to plan and then execute in accordance with the plan. The higher in the organization the manager the more abstracted “the plan” becomes from the people who actually accomplish the work – in fact it is often abstracted to stoplight colors: green, yellow, red. However, it’s the _individuals doing the work that matter_; who are the reason why something is green, yellow or red.\n\n_Individuals matter_.\n\n\u003e “Insist on yourself; never imitate. Your own gift you can offer with the cumulative force of a whole life\'s cultivation, but of the adopted talent of another, you have only an extemporaneous, half possession.”\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003ccite\u003e\u0026mdash; Ralph Waldo Emerson\u003c/cite\u003e\n\n#### References\n\n- [Harrison Bergeron - Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.](http://www.tnellen.com/cybereng/harrison.html)\n',

        '\nSuppose you have a service that responds to requests. A "denial of service" (DoS) attack is a type of threat where you flood the service with requests, overwhelming its ability to respond. New service requests are never acknowledged or completed, and are simply dropped by the service, because its ability to perform its function has been compromised.\n\nIt\'s a very simple attack that relies on the attacker\'s ability to "out scale" the service, causing resource depletion and ultimately failure of the service. We can depict it like this:\n\n```shell\nAttacker -("requests")-\u003e Service\n```\n\nA "distributed" denial of service (DDoS) attack is the same thing, using multiple attackers to amplify the request flood. The more "distributed" the attack is (i.e. the more attackers) the more likely it is to succeed, and the harder it is to find and take down all the attackers.\n\n```shell\nAttacker ---\\\nAttacker ---|-("requests")-\u003e Service\nAttacker ---/\n```\n\nIf you can\'t fend off the attackers, you need "buffers" and/or "rate limiters" that can fend off the attack by buffering or dropping spurious requests:\n\n```shell\nAttacker ---\\\nAttacker ---|-("requests")-\u003e[rate limiter]-[buffer]-\u003eService\nAttacker ---/\n```\n\nNow suppose you have a person, or department, in an organization who, being very nice and service oriented, dutifully accepts every single meeting they are invited to attend. Now suppose the person or department is inside the subsidiary of a large organization. It looks like this:\n\n```shell\n+-----------------+\n|  "Corporate"    |\n+-----------------+\n| Human Resources |--"I\'d like a meeting"--\\\n| Finance         |--"I\'d like a meeting"--\\\n| Compliance      |--"I\'d like a meeting"--\\     +-----------------+\n| Legal           |--"I\'d like a meeting"--\\     |  "Subsidiary"   |\n| Procurement     |--"I\'d like a meeting"--|---\u003e +-----------------+\n| Internal Audit  |--"I\'d like a meeting"--/     |   Department    |\n| Technology      |--"I\'d like a meeting"--/     +-----------------+\n| Risk            |--"I\'d like a meeting"--/\n| Etc.            |--"I\'d like a meeting"--/\n+-----------------+\n```\n\nCan you recognize the pattern? Yes, it\'s a distributed denial of service attack.\n\nOf course, none of the departments intend to cause a DDoS attack, nor do they even know it\'s happening. There is generally limited visibility across departments, so each thinks "it\'s just one meeting".\n\nIt gets worse:\n\n```shell\n.                                    +-----------------+\n                                     |    Your Team    |\n+-----------------+                  +-----------------+\n|  "Corporate"    |                           |\n+-----------------+                 "Can we have meetings?"\n| Human Resources |--"meeting"--\\             |\n| Finance         |--"meeting"--\\             v\n| Compliance      |--"meeting"--\\     +-----------------+\n| Legal           |--"meeting"--\\     |  "Subsidiary"   |                  +------------------+\n| Procurement     |--"meeting"--|---\u003e +-----------------+ \u003c---"meetings!"-- | Vendors/Partners |\n| Internal Audit  |--"meeting"--/     |   Department    |                  +------------------+\n| Technology      |--"meeting"--/     +-----------------+\n| Risk            |--"meeting"--/             ^\n| Etc.            |--"meeting"--/             |\n+-----------------+               "Can we have meetings too?"\n                                   |                    |\n                          +-----------------+   +-----------------+\n                          |  Subs. Dept.\'s  |   |   Committees    |\n                          +-----------------+   +-----------------+\n```\n\nWe can\'t have the people who actually "do the work" attend dozens or hundreds of hours of meetings per week. We need a spokesperson, or a leader, who will attend on their behalf, and who will respond appropriately for them, and who will let them know if anything important was discussed. This is exactly what happens - and why companies create hierarchy.\n\nThe worse the DDoS attack the deeper the hierarchy must be. The hierarchy is the "buffer" or "rate limiter" of the system.\n\nIn the middle of the hierarchy stack are the "professional meeting attenders". The middle managers who everyone wonders "what is their job?" and "why don\'t they accomplish anything?". Their job is simply to absorb the DDoS attacks so the people below them can work normally and respond to service requests. According to a study in Harvard Business Review, [middle managers are the most disgruntled group in the workforce](https://hbr.org/2014/11/why-middle-managers-are-so-unhappy), do you wonder why?\n\nThose at the top of the organization see their roles as \'agents of change\' and they launch initiatives in their areas to \'make the business better\' but of course this is the primary source of the DDoS attacks. These programs generate hundreds (thousands?) of hours of meetings each across the organization.\n\nFor example, the [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2014/04/how-a-weekly-meeting-took-up-300000-hours-a-year) discovered that at one company a **weekly executive meeting was consuming 300,000 hours of time** annually. 1 weekly meeting took up 7,000 hours (headcount x hours x weeks). However, that forced 11 unit meetings (20,000 hours), forced 21 team meetings (63,000 hours) and forced 130 preparatory meetings (210,000 hours) in a chain reaction. Here\'s the kicker: **that total doesn\'t even include the preparation time for the meetings!**\n\nLaunching too many \'make the business better\' programs at once inevitably makes it worse. It requires more layers of middle management to absorb the DDoS attack on its employees that ensues. Or they simply get overwhelmed, and the underlying services suffer resource depletion and ultimately stop responding.\n\nThis is the paradox of change, too little and you fall behind, too much and you overwhelm your capacity and slow everything down. The truly enlightened organizations have the right metrics and incentives that drive consistent **change, innovation and excellence inside the business areas themselves.** No meetings necessary.\n\n\u003e Meetings should be like salt - a spice sprinkled carefully to enhance a dish, not poured recklessly over every forkful. Too much salt destroys a dish. Too many meetings destroy morale and motivation.\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003ccite\u003e\u0026mdash; Jason Fried\u003c/cite\u003e\n\n_If you think this looks sensationalized, or you think there is no person or department that everyone wants to meet with with sadly you are wrong. Everyone wants to meet with technology - all the time. Risk, compliance, legal, audit, finance, every committee, every operations area, every distribution area, countless vendors, countless consultants, etc. It\'s actually worse than I show above, and worse than you imagine._\n\n#### References\n\n- [This Weekly Meeting Took Up 300,000 Hours a Year](https://hbr.org/2014/04/how-a-weekly-meeting-took-up-300000-hours-a-year)\n- [Why Middle Managers Are So Unhappy](https://hbr.org/2014/11/why-middle-managers-are-so-unhappy)\n',

        '\nHow do you measure culture? How do you change culture? What do we even mean by the word "culture"?\n\nMany organizations attempt to measure culture using employee engagement surveys, unplanned turnover metrics, employee burnout measurement, and even Glassdoor comments. Do these measure your culture? No, they measure the **outcomes** of your culture.\n\nWhat if you aren\'t achieving the outcomes you desire? If you want to change or improve your culture you must focus on the **ingredients** of a great culture, not the outcomes. The "inputs", or "drivers" of culture are those that will lead to the cultural outcome you desire. What do those ingredients look like?\n\n![Culture Diagram](/assets/blog/img/culture2.jpg)\n\nSide Note: One of the values in my family was following the rules. We had a defined bedtime as children, and we were expected to adhere to it. In my view my family just "followed the rules". My friends interpreted that as my parents being strict. Interestingly, my friends had the exact same bedtime, but their parents just didn\'t enforce it. They had the same "rules" but a different cultural outcome. Another way to say this is one aspect of culture is not the slogan on the wall but rather how you allow people to behave. What you _actually_ allow vs. what you _say_ you allow. Its why metrics are important - you have to measure the ingredients, not just the outcomes.\n\n## Cultural Ingredients\n\n### 1. Communication\n\nWith strong communication, employees are able to communicate their thoughts and suggestions to leadership, while leadership effectively communicates necessary information to employees.\n\nAre our current channels of communication effective at helping everyone in the company send, receive and understand information?\n\n**Possible metrics:**\n\n- Ask employees to rate communication, how is it working top down, across the company and in your department? Focus groups are effective ways to measure internal communications.\n- Number of posts in Technology Teams channels\n- Email open rates\n- Intranet analytics\n\n### 2. Innovation\n\nInnovation is one of my favorite subjects. It is closely related to communication, because it comes down to whether employees:\n\n1. Are crystal clear about what the company is trying to accomplish - the priorities and goals.\n2. Can move ideas through the organization (and how much your company is open to new ideas).\n3. Feel like innovating is just "part of job", it is expected and encouraged.\n\nWhen measuring innovation, remember that it comes in many forms, such as resources, processes, behaviors and the product itself.\n\n**Possible metrics:**\n\n- Ask employees if they understand the goals of the organization?\n- Do they feel like their ideas are heard and acted upon?\n- Do they see others innovating?\n- Do they feel the company values innovation and are they "invited" to participate?\n\n### 3. Agility\n\nAgility is key to staying competitive. Agile organizations can quickly redirect their people and priorities toward value-creating opportunities. A common misconception is that stability and scale must be sacrificed for speed and flexibility. Truly agile organizations combine both: a strong "spine" provides the stability and "muscles" for developing and scaling dynamic capabilities.\n\nStructural stability (standard operating procedures) and cultural stability (shared purpose, direction, and values) is necessary to support dynamic capabilities (e.g. fluid changes to strategy and products). Otherwise it may feel like chaos.\n\nAgility is also related to strong internal communications - changing views of the market and priorities need to be clearly and quickly communicated to employees; along with "why" they are important.\n\nAgility can be enabled by:\n\n1. A network of autonomous, empowered teams each with clear objectives. What is each team\'s "north star"?\n2. There can be no overlap between teams (which creates internal politics that will slow down agility).\n3. Autonomy is enabled by creating cross-functional teams with full end-to-end accountability for specific goals and/or products.\n4. Rapid decisions, short learning cycles in each team.\n5. Dynamic people, who have a shared passion for what they do. If someone on the team is not performing the team needs to ability to "vote them off the island". Put another way, if the team does not the ability to directly choose its members it must at least have the ability to choose who is _not_ on the team.\n\n\u003e "Without purpose and autonomy, you’re in a world where people come in to work, they do their little bit, and they go home. They aren\'t engaged because they are not sure where that fits into the big scheme of things, and they are focused internally, not on the customer. Teams need direct ownership and real-time accountability, plus absolute clarity about how their mission fits into the company\'s mission. That’s where engagement comes from — employee engagement goes off the chart because people have richer jobs, they’ve got a broader perspective, and they’re focused on solving problems. They don’t feel like hamsters — they feel like they’re part of a squad that’s on a mission."\n\nFinally, studies show that it\'s truly a blessing to have long tenured, experienced employees. You just don\'t want to allow them to become stale and bored. They should have a new role/opportunity on a new team every 18-36 months to keep them engaged and fresh.\n\n**Possible metrics:**\n\n- Ask employees to rate agility, what is slowing them down?\n- Ask employees what is their team\'s "north star"?\n- Do they have the skills and resources to achieve their mission?\n- Do they feel they get to decide "how" they achieve their mission?\n- How do they handle teammates who are not engaged?\n- Number of projects deferred or canceled in favor of newer projects/priorities? If no programs/projects are ever deprioritized it\'s nearly impossible to be agile as we add new projects to respond to market conditions. Teams become overwhelmed and may burn out.\n\n### 4. Wellness\n\nWellness encompasses the mental and physical health of employees. Not only does wellness lead to happier and more productive employees but this metric also has an important ripple effect. According to [a study in Health Affairs](http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/29/2/304.full), medical costs and absentee costs fall about $3.27 and $2.73 respectively for every dollar spent on wellness programs.\n\nHowever, this metric is _not_ about reducing healthcare costs (although it may be an outcome) - it is about making sure employees know the company cares about them and is helping them with their personal wellness journey. This journey can take many forms, both physical and spiritual. It also means the company accepts them for who they are, so it touches on diversity and inclusion for all employees.\n\nSince we are social animals, wellness also stems from feeling connected - a sense of social connectedness to the organization.\n\n**Possible metrics:**\n\n- Ask employees to rate their perceived "wellness level"? (stress, exercise, work hours, etc.)\n- Ask employees if they feel they can be authentic and be themselves at work.\n- Ask employees if they consider coworkers as friends.\n- Measure sick days, absence trends\n- Employ the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) to measure employee burnout\n\n### 5. Work Environment\n\nYou don’t need a trendy office to have an effective work environment. What is most important is that the workplace provides for comfortable, productive employees. For instance, small details, such as the temperature of the office, or ambient noise, could be resulting in big losses in productivity. Focus on employee comments related to the workplace, and you will find some of the easiest and fastest ways to improve the work environment.\n\nSome office environments are noisy, lack privacy, or are simply to stimulating for deep thought. Employees may "self-select" by working away from the office when they "just need to get something done". Pay attention because that may indicate issues with the environment. Just like in a hotel, the "occupancy rate" is an important metric to watch as it can indicate how changes affect employees desire to be in the office.\n\n**Possible metrics:**\n\n- Ask employees, they\'ll tell you!\n- Measure occupancy rate.\n- Observe those employees that choose to work outside the office and ask why.\n\n### 6. Collaboration\n\nCollaboration has many layers, and once again, employee feedback is the key. To assess collaboration, look for collaboration within teams, as well as collaboration between teams.\n\nMany people focus on collaboration _tools_: email, the intranet, corporate social media, video conferencing, instant messaging, etc. Collaboration isn\'t about tools, it\'s about **behavior**.\n\nCollaborative behaviors include:\n\n1. **Psychological safety** - Creating an environment that makes it **safe to openly communicate** unlocks collaboration. It also unlocks the power of diversity because one of the most powerful tenets of inclusiveness is an environment in which people feel free to express themselves.\n\n2. **Communicating** — leaders need to model open and effective communication, and appropriate delegation to foster collaboration within and across teams. Collaboration cannot thrive where people are simply told what to do.\n\n3. **Delegating** — Decisions are one area where collaboration can either help or detract from progress. Companies with highly collaborative cultures make slow decisions, and evidence suggests they are not better decisions. Even worse is when companies try to make decisions unanimous - employees who disagree feel stifled. An essential component of good collaboration is clarity about who is authorized to make decisions.\n\n4. **Managing meetings** — Collaborate with the right people! Only invite those with the needed skills and knowledge to meetings and assign a stated purpose/goal to each meeting. Avoid "meeting tourists", and for those who desire to know what happened in the meeting update them asynchronously after.\n\n**Possible metrics:**\n\n- Ask employees - do they feel safe when they collaborate?\n- Do employees feel leadership is modeling collaborative behaviors?\n- Do employees feel meetings have the "right" attendees? Meetings should be used to make decisions. Meetings simply to provide a status update are better handled through a status report.\n\n### 7. Support\n\nEmployees should feel supported by the overall company, their manager and peers. As leaders, we cannot control the way an employee feels at work. We cannot demand engagement, job satisfaction, or motivation in the workplace. We cannot demand that any employee feels valued.\n\nWe **can** do the things that employees want and need to feel valued and supported at work. If your people believe you’re not valuing or supporting them, eventually they’ll find a leader who does — a leader who truly appreciates their energy, effort, and results.\n\nEveryone should understand what determines success in their role, and they should be rewarded or recognized accordingly. Larger rewards do not necessarily make for a stronger culture. Instead, take time to understand _if_ employees feel they are appreciated and _how_ they would like to be recognized.\n\nAccording to a study in Harvard Business Review, [middle managers are the most disgruntled group in the workforce](https://hbr.org/2014/11/why-middle-managers-are-so-unhappy), possibly because they are lacking the support they need to be successful.\n\n**Possible metrics:**\n\n- Ask employees!\n- Think positive - are we encouraging success or correcting mistakes? Encouraging success makes people feel valued.\n- Are we celebrating success? Are we recognizing and rewarding employees? (How\'s our DVIP pool?)\n- Are we celebrating milestones in years of employment? Do we value tenure? Do we celebrate careers? Careers are different than job titles. Valuing employees in the workplace means also valuing all the experience, insight, and advice they’ve gained that helps them be their best in their current role and helps your team. Celebrate the years of service they give to you, and the years of experience they’ve gained throughout their career.\n- Do we have solid training and skills development opportunities?\n\n### 8. Responsibility\n\nResponsibility encompasses employee accountability for actions and results, as well as the ability to make decisions regarding their work. While it seems like an individual metric, these behaviors should be promoted and assessed on a company-wide level. And believe me, you’ll find that employees are eager to report back on their experience in this area.\n\nGood people thrive under clear responsibility and accountability. They seek it out. Employees who don\'t want responsibility or accountablity are damaging to the organization.\n\n**Possible metrics:**\n\n- Define Accountable Behavior.\n- Create SMART Goals and Measure Results.\n- Do employees have clear performance metrics?\n- Are employee reviews and check-ins conducted in a timely manner?\n\n### 9. Mission and Value Alignment\n\nThe first step is having a mission statement and company values. Vision and mission statements must be real and relevant, not an insipid product of forced strategic planning theater. If they aren\'t "real" they won\'t unite and inspire employees and could imbue more cynicism into the workforce.\n\nIronically, the main reason that companies will refuse to measure their vision or mission is the claim that they are deliberately broad for aspirational purposes and deliberately vague so everyone can find their own meaning in them. Being broad and vague means they cannot/will not drive employee energy and focus.\n\nHere\'s an example:\n\n\u003e “To refresh the world… To inspire moments of optimism and happiness… To create value and make a difference.”\n\nCan you guess the company? ........ It\'s Cola Cola.\n\nOnce you have a **real** mission and values you should make sure employees _know_ your mission and values, _understand_ them, and _live_ by them. This process starts during recruitment, and continues during the employee\'s tenure with the company.\n\nTo be clear and actionable for employees your guiding principles or values must be verbs, not nouns. Examples:\n\n- Instead of "Integrity": "Always do the right thing"\n- Instead of "Innovation": "Think Different", or "Look at the problem from a different angle"\n- Instead of "Client Focus": "Always make decisions with the client\'s best interests in mind"\n\nThis makes how you should act clear and unambiguous.\n\n**Possible metrics:**\n\n- Do employees know the Mission, Vision and Values of the company? Does it inspire them?\n- Do employees understand how their role is aligned to the company\'s mission?\n- Do employees like the mission and values of the company? Does it align with their personal values?\n- Does it provide enough clarity to drive daily decisions and priorities within the organization?\n- Is it measurable? A company can\'t claim that it is excelling if it doesn\'t have an objective measure of how well it’s fulfilling its mission and employees won\'t care.\n\n## Culture Outcomes\n\nIf you get the ingredients right, you should achieve the culture you desire. The results should be visible in the "outcome" metrics we are familiar with:\n\n### Employee Engagement\n\nWhat is employee engagement?\n\n- **Quantum Workplace** - "Employee engagement is the strength of the mental and emotional connection employees feel toward their places of work."\n\n- **Gallup** - "Engaged employees as those who are involved in, enthusiastic about and committed to their work and workplace."\n\n- **Willis Towers Watson** – "Engagement is employees\' willingness and ability to contribute to company success."\n\n- **Aon Hewitt** - Employee engagement is "the level of an employee\'s psychological investment in their organization."\n\nBehaviors of engaged employees:\n\n| **Engaged behaviors**                 | **Disengaged behaviors**              |\n| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |\n| Optimistic                            | Pessimistic                           |\n| Team-oriented                         | Self-centered                         |\n| Goes above and beyond                 | High absenteeism                      |\n| Solution-oriented                     | Negative attitude                     |\n| Selfless                              | Egocentric                            |\n| Shows a passion for learning          | Focuses on monetary worth             |\n| Passes along credit but accepts blame | Accepts credit but passes along blame |\n\nSix drivers of employee engagement that have the greatest impact:\n\n1. Trust in the leaders of the organization to set the right course.\n2. Belief that the organization will be successful in the future.\n3. Belief that leaders are committed to making it a great place to work.\n4. Understanding of how they fit into the organization\'s future plans.\n5. Belief that leaders of the organization value them (employees).\n6. Visible investments made to make employees more successful.\n\n### Voluntary Turnover\n\nNot every employee who is thinking about quitting will report so if asked. They may not answer honestly in employee engagement surveys about how satisfied they are with their work (especially if they’re concerned about getting fired for a negative review). Looking at voluntary employee turnover statistics can help uncover how effective company culture is at retaining employees—and avoid high employee attrition.\n\n### Employee Burnout\n\nThe Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) is the first scientifically developed measure of burnout and is used widely in research studies around the world. Since its first publication in 1981, it has been considered the gold standard. When used correctly, the applications of the MBI can greatly benefit employees.\n\nBurnout is measured via a combination of dimensions: exhaustion, cynicism and professional efficacy. These measurements not only measure burnout but other outcomes/results as well:\n\n- _Burnout:_ negative scores on exhaustion, cynicism, and professional efficacy\n- _Overextended:_ strong negative score on exhaustion only\n- _Ineffective:_ strong negative score on professional efficacy only\n- _Disengaged:_ strong negative score on cynicism only\n- _Engagement:_ strong positive scores on exhaustion, cynicism, and professional efficacy\n\nNote the relationship of measuring employee burnout to employee engagement.\n\n## Examples of effective programs\n\n### JetBlue\n\nThe airline employs a robust measurement program and tracks, among other metrics, employee satisfaction scores. According to Ann Rhoades, co-founder of JetBlue, former Chief People Officer of Southwest Airlines and Promus Hotel Company, “When an employee tells us they are very happy to be part of the organization, we calculate that number. It is a measure for all of our managers **and a portion of their bonus was based on the employee satisfaction score** in their department.”\n\nRhoades stressed that it’s important that every person is involved in meeting the metrics and goals. As an example, “The first day you come to work for us, we explain to you what the **main metrics are including cost per available seat mile and revenue per available seat mile.**”\n\nJetBlue also actively uses a Net Promoter Score for employees. “When you get your six-month and 12-month employee satisfaction score, we ask you to tell us how long you intend to stay with us and would you recommend to family and friends to fly with and to work for JetBlue,” Rhoades said. “Those are critically important metrics for us.  It tells us whether our people are recruiting other A-players to work for us and whether they’re also telling their family that this is a great brand. If your own people aren’t promoting the company you have a serious problem.\n\n### Zappos\n\nWell known for its commitment to culture, Zappos management places a high priority on the concept of connectedness to support its core values. To measure success in supporting this connectedness, the firm uses several tools including a Face game that, along with FaceMail, encourages employees to know each other and associate faces with names. Its effectiveness is regularly measured with an internal feedback system called Z60.\n\n### Resources\n\n- [How to Measure Burnout Accurately and Ethically](https://hbr.org/2021/03/how-to-measure-burnout-accurately-and-ethically)\n- [The 10 Company Culture Metrics You Should Be Tracking Right Now](https://cultureiq.com/blog/10-company-culture-metrics/)\n- [The Hazards of a “Nice” Company Culture](https://hbr.org/2021/06/the-hazards-of-a-nice-company-culture)\n- [High-Performing Teams Start with a Culture of Shared Values](https://hbr.org/2021/05/high-performing-teams-start-with-a-culture-of-shared-values)\n- [Employee Net Promoter Score](https://www.questionpro.com/blog/employee-net-promoter-score-enps/)\n- [Enterprise agility: Buzz or business impact?](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/enterprise-agility-buzz-or-business-impact#)\n',

        '\n[GitHub](https://github.com/) (owned by [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/)), has partnered with [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) to create an AI tool called [Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/) that **writes code for you**. It is a plugin to [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which auto-generates code based on the contents of the current file, and your current cursor location.\n\nOpen AI developed [Codex](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03374), a deep neural network language model that translates natural language into code, and Codex is integrated with Copilot. Side note: _OpenAI runs on Microsoft Azure_.\n\nOpenAI\'s Codex was trained on publicly available source code and natural language, so it understands **both programming and human languages**. Codex is an API-driven service that has many more capabilities, which developers can explore — and build into their own apps — when OpenAI opens access to Codex later this year (2021).\n\nCodex was trained on billions of lines of code, uploaded by the 65 million users of GitHub. The aim is for Codex to learn enough about the patterns in that code that it can see what you are trying to do and write the code for you. It is like mob programming with 65 million of your peers!\n\nGitHub eventually plans to sell access to Copilot to developers as a productivity tool.\n\n### How it Works\n\nIn practice, you write a human-readable comment describing the logic you want, and you start coding. Copilot will make suggestions to complete the code. Automatically, seamlessly, and fast enough that your workflow will not be interrupted. GitHub Copilot is a code **synthesizer**, not a search engine: most of the code that it suggests is **uniquely generated and has never been seen before**. This is very germane to the legal questions we will explore below.\n\n![Copilot Diagram](/assets/blog/img/copilot3.jpg)\n\nThe GitHub Copilot editor extension sends your comments and code to the GitHub Copilot service, which then uses OpenAI Codex to synthesize and suggest individual lines and whole functions. GitHub Copilot also records whether the suggestions are accepted or rejected. This telemetry is used to improve future versions of the AI system, so that GitHub Copilot can make better suggestions in the future.\n\n![Copilot Quote](/assets/blog/img/copilot2.jpg)\n\n### You are Contributing Value (whether you like it not)\n\nThe models gain insight and accuracy from the public collective intelligence. If you have code that is publicly available you are helping create Copilot, and value for GitHub, and the only way to extract value back out is to use Copilot yourself.\n\n“Fair use” of copyrighted material depends on whether it is “transformed” when it is reused. There are many ways of transforming a work, like using it for parody or criticism or summarizing it.\n\nTraining machine learning models on publicly available data is generally considered fair use across the machine learning community. Here is [OpenAI\'s position, as submitted to the USPTO](https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/OpenAI_RFC-84-FR-58141.pdf) on fair use.\n\n### Virtuous Circle\n\n1. Programmers like to use GitHub to maintain their code repositories. It is already the de-facto home for Open-Source projects and many programmers also keep their personal repositories on GitHub (I do).\n\n2. Copilot was trained on literally billions of lines of code from these GitHub repositories.\n\n3. Microsoft offers a very extensible Integrated Development Environment (IDE) called Visual Studio Code, or VSCode that many programmers already use. GitHub Copilot is available today only as a Visual Studio Code extension.\n\n\u003e "For now, we’re focused on delivering the best experience in Visual Studio Code only."\n\nCopilot will create a virtuous circle because **drive programmers to use VSCode** they will be more productive. The code suggestions they choose from Copilot will further train Copilot so it will make even better suggestions. Programmers save their code on GitHub because eventually it will improve Copilot, which further improves their productivity and code quality.\n\nThis virtuous circle is a way to solidify GitHub as "the" place to store your code.\n\n### Legal Issues Remain Uncharted Territory\n\nThere’s a lot of public code in the world with insecure coding patterns, bugs, or other issues. If you program using Copilot and accept one of its suggestions, and that specific suggestion creates a security vulnerability in your code, who is liable? GitHub\'s position is that you are 100% responsible for your code and Copilot is just a helpful tool.\n\nIn other words, it\'s like spell check, and when you use spell check in a legal document what if it suggests a word that changes the meaning of the document? Who is liable? Copilot takes this one step further - imagine while writing a document and spell check started suggesting whole paragraphs, or pages of content (hint: _GPT-3 can do this already_)?\n\nThe other main concern is that even if Copilot synthesizes code, rather than regurgitating it, it could synthesize code that is an **exact replica** of non-open, protected code. If the Copilot-generated code becomes the reason for infringement, who is accountable? How can anyone prove the code was generated by Copilot and not the project owner?\n\nToday, a human still must review and accept the code suggestions, which providers of Copilot argue transfers all liability. This makes sense for code that may not work properly or be secure because a human (or automated) review could be reasonably expected to handle those situations. But no human, or code review system, can reasonably be expected to know if a code sequence matches an existing, licensed code sequence.\n\nThe clear legal issue for users of Copilot discussed by IP lawyer [Kate Downing](https://fossa.com/blog/analyzing-legal-implications-github-copilot/) is that in some cases using Copilot’s suggestions may be a breach of license (or require relicensing your own work under a GPL-compatible license):\n\n\u003e "The more complex and lengthy the suggestion, the more likely it has some sort of copyrightable expression."\n\n### See Copilot Answer Leetcode Code Interview Questions\n\nLet\'s watch Copilot in action answering leetcode coding interview questions:\n\n\u003cYouTube link="https://youtu.be/FHwnrYm0mNc" /\u003e\n\n### Lower Barriers to Entry for Coders\n\nHow disruptive will Copilot be for the Software Engineering Industry? Creating intelligent systems to "co-code" with you will bring enormous change to the developer experience. GitHub Copilot has the potential to lower barriers to entry, enabling more people to explore software development and join the next generation of developers. This opens the door for many people who may not otherwise be able to get a developer position, but it will **almost certainly lower wages for entry level programmers** who code in common languages.\n\nHowever, **software engineering is not the same thing as writing code**. Software engineering is a much more profound task that implies broad knowledge, problem solving skills, and creativity. Copilot could actually increase demand and increase wages for solution architects, senior lead developers, and others with more experience and specialized skills. As "writing the code" becomes more commoditized, **more experienced people will likely be in higher demand** to "oversee" the work.\n\n### References\n\n- [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/)\n- [GitHub’s Commercial AI Tool Was Built From Open Source Code](https://www.wired.com/story/github-commercial-ai-tool-built-open-source-code/)\n- [Is GitHub Copilot a blessing, or a curse?](https://www.fast.ai/2021/07/19/copilot/)\n- [FSF: Call for white papers on philosophical and legal questions around Copilot](https://www.fsf.org/blogs/licensing/fsf-funded-call-for-white-papers-on-philosophical-and-legal-questions-around-copilot)\n',

        "\nThe first question executives will ask when they find out their company has fallen victim to ransomware is \"_Are we paying the ransom or not?_\".\n\nThe Colonial Pipeline breach that crippled the East Coast’s fuel supply recently was not particularly sophisticated. It has been traced back to a VPN login that was compromised. The credentials had leaked already and appeared in a dark web password cache. The VPN credentials allowed the attackers to gain access to Colonial's network by simply logging in (multi-factor authentication was not in use). Once inside they were able to gain elevated privileges to encrypt files.\n\nCompanies that are attacked, and pay the ransom, are typically less secure than most. However even with robust security, it will [never be perfect](/posts/2015-09-26-is-it-secure). Therefore, preparation and recovery should be a higher focus, even for highly secure companies.\n\nWithout thorough preparation many victims **still pay the ransom even when they have the means to restore everything**.\n\n### Why Pay?\n\nReasons ransomware targets still pay (even when they have reliable backups) are:\n\n1. **Nobody bothered to test in advance how long the data restoration process might take**. For example, what if an organization stores backups on AWS Glacier? If they get attacked by ransomware, they may suddenly discover they have terabytes (or petabytes) of data to restore over the Internet, and that even with a fast connection it’s going to take months to download all the backup data. Many technology teams don't even have a back-of-the-napkin calculation of how long it would take for a full, complete restore.\n\n2. Sometimes victims that have off-site, encrypted backups of their data but discover that **the digital keys needed to decrypt their backups were stored on the same local file-sharing network that was encrypted by the ransomware**.\n\n3. Maybe you have the data backed up and accessible, but your **software was stored on the same local file-sharing network that got encrypted by the ransomware**. You have backups, but the application to do the restoration is encrypted, or the software you need to reinstall is encrypted.\n\n4. Finally, **many companies don’t know their systems dependencies**, and so they don’t know in which order they should build/restore systems. Nor do they have a clear repeatable process to configure systems - they find they have been cloning a build image Larry created before he left last year.\n\nIf you haven't thought about these things then **yes, you are paying the ransom**. \n\n### Ransomware Protection\n\nThere are three themes to get right to protect your organization against ransomware: Prevention, Preparation and Recovery.\n\n1. **Prevention** stops attacks before they happen.\n2. **Preparation** ensures backups are good, accessible, and restorable in a reasonable timeframe.\n3. **Recovery** minimizes the damage, speeds rebuilding, and avoids paying the ransom.\n\nOrganizations seem to be thinking mainly about how to prevent getting hit by ransomware, or recovery. This article will cover all three areas but mainly focus on preparation.\n\n### Prevention\n\nThere is nothing special about ransomware prevention. It is \"Security 101\". All normal security and anti-malware practices apply.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Keep software updated and patched.\n- Use anti-virus and anti-malware software.\n- Use security policies to prevent malware from launching.\n- Use good email hygiene. Train your employees against phishing.\n- Keep your administrative surface area small. This means not giving your users admin privileges.\n- Use multi-factor authentication (Google introduced MFA logins for users and eliminated the threat of phishing).\n\nThere is a wealth of information about security best practices on the web. No need to repeat it here.\n\n### Preparation\n\n#### 1. You Need People Who Understand Technology\n\nThis is number one - **ransomware is a professional business**. Criminals literally earn their living by attacking companies like yours. Companies need skilled technical people because of the sheer aggregation of risk; they are your last line of defense. If you do get hit with ransomware you want people on payroll, and on site, ASAP. You don't want to call your technology sourcing partner when you get hit and have them put you on hold while they take calls from their bigger clients that have also been hit with the same malware. Or worse, they have been hit too.\n\nYou probably don't need a group of Rockstar 10x-types, but you do need solid, fundamental IT knowledge and ability to solve technical challenges. There's no glamour or glory in busines continuity, and thus it's more challenging to gain funding, unlike information security.\n\n#### 2. Clean House\n\nScrub old data you don't need. Backups will be an order of magnitude smaller, easier to manage, more reliable, cheaper, and **faster to restore**. In the event of a ransomware attack recovery speed is paramount. This is so fundamental **and yet so hard to do** in many companies. I could say more here but my instinct is just to repeat the first sentence over and over.\n\n#### 3. Automate System Provisioning and Configuration\n\nIn the old days machine configurate was a hand-crafted art. In many cases systems were configured as an artist molds clay. Little bits added and changed over time but recreating the steps would be impossible. Especially when they were configured by Frank, but he left 2 years ago, and he never documented anything.\n\nIf we virtualized the configured machine, the entire machine can now be copied and/or backed up - it's **exact** configuration is preserved. That is step one. Most machines are already virtual these days though, and you really must have a process to create machines in a repeatable manner.\n\nStep two automates machine provisioning ([pets vs. cattle](https://cloudscaling.com/blog/cloud-computing/the-history-of-pets-vs-cattle/)). Using tools like Git, Chef, Ansible, and Terraform, it is possible to create a fully automated process to instantiate machines in a repeatable manner. I've seen an Ansible playbook that does 200 administrative tasks for each of the servers for a particular environment - all the configuration is version-controlled within Git repositories. Changes are applied by CI, all the process thoroughly documented.\n\nEverything from installing packages, creating or removing user accounts, setting up firewall rules, setting up directories and sending the necessary configuration, systemd services for legacy stuff, container clusters, container deployments, monitoring, container registries, analytics, APM and so on are handled this way.\n\nNo one should have write access on the server itself (unless explicitly given in the playbook, or the admins) and even the servers themselves can be wiped and reinstalled with a newer OS version (mostly thanks to Docker), plus all of the changes are auditable, since they coincide with the Git repo history.\n\nAutomated configuration means it's repeatable, can be tested, and can be done in the event of an emergency (**as long as your tools and scripts were not encrypted by the ransomware!**).\n\n#### 4. Immutable Backups\n\nYour backup strategy is one of the first things you should review. It's quite likely it was designed for a failure scenario (hardware failure, accidental deletion), not for an attack scenario. But attackers, once they get access to your systems, will delete or encrypt all backup sets they can access.\n\nMirroring and data replication are great for availability but bad for backup purposes - if the files being replicated become encrypted via ransomware it is possible the mirroring will just copy the freshly encrypted file(s) or data to the other location.\n\nIn fact, you should monitor disk activity. If you get hit your disk usage will suddenly skyrocket as it rewrites/encrypts all your files. Your mirroring or replication network traffic will also spike up.\n\nKeep immutable, offline, air gapped backups:\n\n1. Use a CoW (copy-on-write) filesystem like btrfs or ZFS\n\n2. Set up snapshots to be taken periodically (hourly/daily) and sent to a different host or volume with some type of immutable file system.\n\n3. Manually backup snapshots or the full volume to offline, air gapped storage every N days/weeks/months.\n\n4. Figure out how you'll stop a someone who gets in from deleting or accessing your backups. Assume they'll be attacked. Understand what the backup solutions offer in terms of security. Can you use protection on an S3 storage bucket to prevent deletion, even with the access key? Don't let **anything** delete or format any backup volumes.\n\n5. If you're going to use encrypted backups, understand where the keys are stored and how they're used. More importantly, understand how you'll have the keys to decrypt the backups after a disaster. Can you use asymmetric crypto so only public keys get stored on your servers?\n\n6. Make the offsite backup 'pull' based - so the credentials to access the data already backed up do not exist on the system being backed up.\n\n7. Ensure you have enough copies. One isn't enough - what if the payment card on your storage account expires, or you get locked out? Three backups in two locations, at least one off-premises.\n\n8. There's all sorts of other things to consider like data consistency and whether operations on your systems are atomic (what happens if the backup snapshot is taken mid-operation in your app?) that you'll want to think about too.\n\n#### 5. Monitor Your Backup Processes\n\nSet up monitoring so you know when something goes wrong with your backups. Gather and expose enough information to know exactly what's going on. This could be as simple as an automated email every morning, showing the duration of the backup job, and the amount of data written, and amount changed since last time. But you need to monitor this. Don't just go for a failure alarm (have one of those and make it fail-safe so it alerts if the backup didn't succeed, even if the backup script didn't run at all) also notify yourself on success so you are aware of the backups and what normal metrics look like.\n\n#### 6. Test Restoration\n\nAssume your backup will not be restorable unless proven otherwise. Practice restoring to a non-production environment to see what you missed. Document everything. In the old days tape media went bad, tape catalogs became corrupted, the label on the tape didn't match the contents. Today there are much better technologies but assume your systems cannot be restored unless this has been recently tested.\n\n#### 7. Define Rebuild Steps\n\nWhen rebuilding a new \"cleanroom\" environment there are many prerequisites and \"order of operation\" issues. You need DNS to access the Internet and DHCP services to assign IP addresses to machines. You need authentication, and many other dependencies will soon become apparent.\n\nStart with tabletop exercises to simply think through and document your systems dependencies and order of operations necessary to rebuild. Document this process and store copies documentation in a place that is separate, and air gapped from your main environment.\n\nDivide the rebuild into stages:\n\n1. Prepare cleanroom\n2. Establish new network perimeter\n3. Establish new core services (DHS, DHCP, Authentication, etc.) inside perimeter\n4. Initialize rebuild process, create new admin accounts...\n5. Etc.\n\nIt may not be feasible to test a full rebuild scenario but even testing and practicing the initial stages is very important for an accelerated recovery. These steps are typically the ones that trip up ransomware victims.\n\n### Recovery\n\n**This is where is gets interesting**. Most disaster scenarios do not contemplate rebuilding all your systems starting in a cleanroom. How many companies practice this specific kind of recovery? How many feel truly prepared?\n\nThere are three main steps in recovery:\n\n1. **Containment** - involves rapid response by severing network connections and taking systems offline so they don’t infect other systems.\n\n2. **Eradication** - means wiping the malware from the system and/or completely rebuilding the system. Executives might think, why rebuild the system? However, as we know some malware embeds itself into systems in ways that make it impossible to eradicate without rebuilding the system from scratch. In any case, this process takes time. And interestingly it may take the **same amount of time if you pay the ransom or not because in either case you must rebuild all your systems to eradicate the ransomware** - this is often the most time-consuming step. Of course, the manner of infection must be tracked down and the vulnerability addressed, or you will be reinfected.\n\n3. **Recovery** - Once they systems are rebuilt in a cleanroom the data can be restored and the system brought online. This a very delicate process because if the malware was not fully eradicated you will re-infect yourself. Each system must be brought online and validated in as isolated a manner as possible, in the correct sequence.\n\nIf you haven't thought about and tested ransomware recovery scenarios prior to becoming infected then **yes, you are paying the ransom**.\n\n### References\n\n- [The Tao of Backup](http://www.taobackup.com/)\n- [How to Negotiate with Ransomware Hackers](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/06/07/how-to-negotiate-with-ransomware-hackers)\n",

        '\nPeople go into technology because they love building new things, solving business problems, and making businesses operate better. **The last thing on earth most technologists want to say is “no”.**\n\nThere are unintuitive signs that indicate a technology team might be overwhelmed or underfunded, such as buying premium support contracts, or using expensive consultants. When your technology team starts telling you no, or stops answering email, it\'s likely they are feeling overwhelmed. At their core they **really do want to help**.\n\nHere are the telltale signs of an underfunded technology organization. If you recognize these signs in your own technology organization, you should be concerned:\n\n- **No Seat at the Table**: Technology is not valued/strategic, so the CIO will report into a Chief Operating Officer, or worse the Chief Financial Officer.\n- **Outdated Technology**: Due to lack of investment, it is likely running older technologies. You know, things like mainframes, older datacenter technologies, older networking, older storage. One company I know of in 2019 had an employee who told me “when I started, I expected to receive a laptop. It’s been seven years and I am still waiting”.\n- **Outdated Skills**: Personnel may have not have kept their skills current. This could be due to lack of investment in training, but also lack of need/desire on the part of the employees. They don’t need current skills to be successful managing older technology. Those that do keep their skills current may eventually leave for better opportunities elsewhere.\n- **Mediocre Hiring**: It will be challenging to attract strong, capable technology talent at the “practitioner” level for obvious reasons - who wants to join an underfunded organization that runs old technology? Existing employee skills may be stale, and therefore it harder for them to evaluate and attract talent with current, market relevant skills.\n- **Mediocre Leadership**: Likely to indict its technology leaders for not doing their jobs keeping things current. There will some truth there because strong leaders may have already left for better opportunities. Since existing leader and employee skills may be stale it will likely decide that outsourcing is the best path forward, driving out remaining capable technology talent.\n- **Less Innovative**: In an underfunded technology organization R\u0026D is often the first thing to be cut. Newer technologies require investment, experimentation, the ability to try things that ultimately don’t pan out. Experimentation doesn’t happen because employees don’t have the time (they aren’t allowed to work on things that aren’t “of the utmost priority”).\n- **Less Proactive**: If the technology team cannot keep up with demand today what hope do they have to think ahead and prepare proactively for what may be coming in the future? "Being proactive" means they have time and space to think ahead and they will anticipate future needs and propose solutions. "Not being proactive" usually means they don\'t have the opportunity to be proactive. In most cases they would like to be proactive more than you might imagine because to them everything feels like an urgent emergency.\n- **Lots of Consultants**: In an underfunded technology organization, paradoxically, executive/senior management will use expensive external consultants for technology advice because they don’t quite trust the technology leadership (who are managing older technologies using employees with stale skills who aren’t very innovative - so it makes perfect sense when you think about it).\n\n  \u003e “When hiring a management-consulting firm, clients do not know what they are getting in advance, because they are looking for knowledge that they themselves lack. They cannot measure the results either, because outside factors, such as the quality of execution, influence the outcome of the consultant’s recommendations.”\n  \u003e\n  \u003e \u003ccite\u003e- Clayton Christensen, Professor, Harvard Business School\u003c/cite\u003e\n\n- **Few(er) Business Analysts**: There will fewer business analysts who can help the business users define their needs and coax out cohesive well thought through requirements. Instead, the business will just lob requests directly to the development teams. This of course leads to missed requirements, poor quality solutions, and too much rework. The business side will complain that the technology team "just doesn\'t get it". The technology team will complain that the business users don\'t grok technology. This is the space that business analysts fill beautifully to meld the two sides together. In an underfunded technology organization they just can\'t afford them.\n- **Increasing Technology Debt**: Technology debt refers to the “catch up” investment that will eventually be required. This is usually invisible to senior management until it manifests in some very obvious and destructive manner. Think “Texas power grid” after years of underinvestment - the problem manifests itself at the worst possible time in a significant, visible way. This ultimately drives a substantial “catch-up” investment which could have been avoided if the right level of investment was made all along, or the company becomes irrelevant (Kmart, Xerox, MySpace, Hitachi, Sears, The Sharper Image, Nortel, etc.)\n- **Increasing Shadow Technology**: Shadow technology is known as technology that is being practiced outside of the technology organization. It can be beneficial, but it can also be suboptimal. In any case, in an organization with an underfunded technology organization it’s almost certain that “shadow technology” is increasing. Areas will attempt to solve their technology problems with or without the technology organization’s help.\n- **Zombie Projects**: In an underfunded technology organization, paradoxically, executive/senior management will not have a rigorous method to defund technology programs that aren’t delivering value. Programs are rarely killed. This is counterintuitive, but since dollars for programs are rare the programs tend to be some senior or executive manager’s pet project and/or they take on a life of their own. Like in politics, these programs tend to attract some “pork”. Funding for programs is rare, and technology debt is high, so in many cases additional unrelated work somehow gets added into the program. A program that is not delivering value is more likely to be attributed to the technology organization underperforming rather than actually taking a hard look at the reasons why (and if the program still makes sense). Unfortunately, in many cases the underfunded technology organization has weak or inexperienced program managers, or none at all – they are supplied by an external PMO, or expensive consultants making the issues worse.\n- **Focus on "Run"**: The technology department is likely spending significant time, energy and resources on risk, compliance and security rather than delivering new business capabilities. This is frustrating to business partners who will think the technology department is no longer “business focused”. It is also very likely the technology employees would vastly prefer to be working on delivering new business capabilities rather than closing security or compliance findings too – they just don\'t have the resources to do both.\n- **Premium Support**: There will be low usage of open-source technology and high usage of vendor software with premium level support contracts. This is because they want to be able to “call the vendor” when something goes wrong, rather than expect (or rely on) their own employees to figure it out.\n- **The Department of "No"**: The technology department becomes known as the department of “no”. Because technology employees become world class experts at saying no to requests for more capabilities or better technology. Not because they want to, because they have to be able to grow this skill to survive.\n\nResource constraints cause many types of unwanted behavior. Resource constrained warehouses might on skimp on buying fire insurance, resource constrained restaurants might skimp on sanitation, Resource constrained power companies might skimp on line maintenance and cause a fire or power outage.\n\nResourced constrained technology departments mainly just want to say "yes" to your requests. **The last thing on earth most technologists want to say is “no”.** Give them enough resources so they can say **"yes"!**\n',

        '\nEvery team has manual procedures or checklists that they haven’t gotten around to automating yet. Sometimes there are branches and special cases to keep track of as you go. Procedures/checklists are frustrating because they’re focus-intensive yet require very little thought. They demand our full attention, but our attention isn’t rewarded with interesting problems or satisfying solutions – just another checkbox checked. Procedures like this are called a **slog**.\n\nSlogs are ripe for automation. We know that a computer could do it better than we can, and with less tendency toward practical drift. However, automating slogs feels like an all-or-nothing proposition. Maybe we could write a script to handle step 2, or step 5, but that wouldn’t really make the procedure any less cumbersome. It would lead to a proliferation of single-purpose scripts with different conventions and expectations, and you’d still have to follow a documented multi-step procedure for using those scripts.\n\nThis **perception of futility** is the problem we really need to solve in order to escape from these manual slogs. Here\'s an approach that works. It\'s called "executable documentation".\n\nAlmost any slog can be turned into executable documentation. Executable documentation is a script that encodes the instructions of a slog, encapsulating each step in a function. For example we could write the following executable documentation script:\n\n```shell\n#! /bin/sh\n# ------------------------------------------------------------\n# Copyright (c) 2014 Dan Stroot\n# All rights reserved.\n# ------------------------------------------------------------\n# NAME:           example.sh\n# PURPOSE:        example of executable documentation\n# VERSION:  1.0   Initial version\n# ------------------------------------------------------------\nset -e\n\n# Default settings\nPROGNAME=$0\nVER="1.0"\n\nstep_1 () {\n    echo "Do step 1, press (y, enter) when complete."\n    read -r response\n    case $response in\n    [yY])\n        echo "Step 1 completed.\\n"\n        ;;\n    *)\n        echo "Step 1 NOT completed.\\n"\n        exit 1\n        ;;\n    esac\n}\n\nstep_2 () {\n    echo "Do step 2, press (y, enter) when complete."\n    read -r response\n    case $response in\n    [yY])\n        echo "Step 2 completed.\\n"\n        ;;\n    *)\n        echo "Step 2 NOT completed.\\n"\n        exit 1\n        ;;\n    esac\n}\n\nstep_3 () {\n    echo "Do step 3, press (y, enter) when complete."\n    read -r response\n    case $response in\n    [yY])\n        echo "Step 3 completed.\\n"\n        ;;\n    *)\n        echo "Step 3 NOT completed.\\n"\n        exit 1\n        ;;\n    esac\n}\n\nmain() {\n    echo "Running: ${PROGNAME}, version ${VER}.\\n"\n    step_1\n    step_2\n    step_3\n    echo "All Done!"\n    echo "Wouldn\'t it be great if this was automated?"\n}\n\nmain "$@"\n```\n\nNotice this script **doesn’t actually do any of the steps of the procedure**! It feeds the user a step at a time and waits for them to complete each step manually. These scripts will have little logic, and make little use of variables. They can also have a .txt filename to ensure that people understand, that first of all, this is a set of instructions for how to do something, which also just so happens to be a valid shell script.\n\nAt first glance, it might not be obvious that this script provides any value, but the value is immense. First, these scripts actually do something: they allow storing and updating the _state_ of a process. By having these scripts run in a shell rather than in your head, the current state is stored in a machine, not your brain.\n\n- It’s now much less likely that you’ll lose your place and skip a step. This makes it easier to maintain focus on the actual work and power through the slog. You can even exit the script and it will tell you where you stopped.\n\n- Each step of the procedure is now encapsulated in a function, which makes it possible to replace the text in any given step with code that actually performs the action.\n\n- Over time, you’ll develop a library of useful steps, which will make future automation tasks more efficient.\n\n- It will lower the inhibition to automation - each run you can just automate one or two more steps.\n\nExecutable documentation doesn’t initially save your team any manual effort. However, **it lowers the activation energy for automating tasks**, which allows the team to eliminate toil over time.\n\nFor example I have a process to reinstall the operating system on my personal laptop from scratch, based on a checklist. I\'d always wanted to automate it but it just seemed like such a daunting task that I never ended up doing it. The frequency of use didn\'t seem to warrant the effort.\n\nLast time I turned the checklist into a script, telling me what to do at each step. Then, since I was scripting rather writing a document I also implemented the ones that are easy to automate. I planned to automate a few more items each time I ran the checklist, until it\'s fully automated. A funny thing happened though - after few runs I had autmated a large portion of the steps, and that motivated me to just knock it out and finish. This is the power of executable documentation.\n\nExecutable documentation as concept can be very broad - many producst are based around the idea of complex tasks "as code". Products like:\n\n- [AWS Cloudformation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/)\n- [Hashicorp Terraform](https://www.terraform.io)\n- [Chef](https://www.chef.io/)\n- [Puppet](https://puppet.com)\n- [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)\n- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org)\n\nSo you can take this concept pretty far!\n\n#### Resources\n\n- [Manual work is a bug](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3197520)\n- [Record shell sessions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tweyWNr6X18)\n- [NYT - The Checklist](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/12/10/the-checklist)\n- [The Simple Genius of Checklists, from B-17 to the Apollo Missions](https://blog.nuclino.com/the-simple-genius-of-checklists-from-b-17-to-the-apollo-missions)\n',

        '\nRecently I took on a new role and I was considering ordering new business cards. I reflected a moment and realized I don\'t really use business cards anymore. I decided that I needed a **digital** way to share my business (and personal) information, and I wanted to be able to control what I share. One of the side benefits of this is I **don\'t have to share my personal mobile phone number** either.\n\nHere\'s the concept - provide a phone number that anyone can send a SMS message (a text) to and receive an automated response with a vCard attached so it can be imported into their electronic contact list with a press of a button.\n\nDepending on what they send in their message my personal and/or employment information would be sent. But the SMS number is **not** my mobile phone number - it is purchased through Twilio and is **only** used to reply with my digital business card. A phone number can be obtained through Twilio for $1 per month and messages cost fractions of cent to send - cheaper than printing and handing out paper business cards.\n\nYou can send a SMS (type anything) to [+1 949 333-0466](tel:+19493330466) to try it out.\n\n### Tech Stack\n\n- [AWS API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/)\n- [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)\n- [Serverless](https://serverless.com/)\n- [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com)\n- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)\n\nThis is a "production ready" stack that took a few hours to build and test. It could scale to millions of users if it had to, but since it\'s "serverless" the code just sits there until someone actually uses it. It deploys for pennies per month. Each outbound MMS costs \\$0.02. Since the code is only ~5mb the storage costs on AWS are nearly zero.\n\nThis has some huge advantages. You can "prove" an application before you scale it and pay for it. It\'s not just fail fast, it\'s also "fail cheap". This is the cheapest application architecture you can create today for launching new services.\n\nThe architecture looks like this:\n\n![architecture](/assets/blog/img/serverless.png)\n\n\u003csmall\u003e\n  NOTE: I didn\'t draw this - it is automatically generated from the\n  CloudFormation script that the Serverless framework creates. Automatic,\n  "perfect", evergreen documentation - because it is showing exactly what is\n  actually deployed. Cool!\n\u003c/small\u003e\n\nAn API gateway endpoint handles all the tasks involved processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls, including traffic management, authorization and access control, monitoring, and API version management. The API gateway talks to my Lambda function.\n\nAWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time you consume - there is no charge when your code is not running. This also results in zero administration. The Lambda function is just a Nodejs function that uses the Twilio javascript library to respond to the API call with my business card information. The code is deployed from an S3 bucket.\n\nIn my organization people are concerned about how we will be able to operate our services and applications in the cloud. This puzzles me because if we architect things properly we should be striving to achieve **zero administration**. This is how you get there!\n\nPrerequisites\n\n- An AWS account\n- A Twilio account\n- Node.js and NPM or Yarn installed on your development machine\n- Use NPM or Yarn to install Serverless:\n\n  ```shell\n  # Installing the serverless cli\n  npm install -g serverless\n  ```\n\n### Steps\n\n#### Create a new service\n\nUse serverless to scaffold a lambda function using the Node.js template.\n\n```shell\n# Create a new Serverless Service/Project\n$ serverless create --template aws-nodejs --path my-service\n\n# Change into the newly created directory\n$ cd my-service\n```\n\n#### Build, test and deploy your service\n\nNOTE: the actual lambda code is in the repo linked below. I am outlining how to use Serverless here.\n\n- Test the function locally. Note "-f" specifies the function and "-p" passes in data to simulate an API call\n\n  ```shell\n  serverless invoke local -f twilio -p data.json\n  ```\n\n- Deploy the Service\n\n  ```shell\n  serverless deploy\n  ```\n\n- Fetch the Function Logs\n\n  ```shell\n  serverless logs -f twilio -t\n  ```\n\n#### Hookup Twilio\n\nOnce your API is up and running you simply point the Twilio webhook of your phone number to your API endpoint:\n\n![Twilio](/assets/blog/img/twilio.png)\n\nWhen an SMS is sent to my Twilio phone number, Twilio calls my API and posts the SMS as the payload. The lambda function formats a response using Twilio\'s XML format and sends it back as the HTTP response. Twilio reads the XML which instructs Twilio to respond with a MMS message with my digital business card information.\n\nFull working code is [here](https://github.com/dstroot/twilio-business-card-aws-lambda)\n',

        '\nYears ago I read a great article on clear communication. Unfortunately it is hard to find these days. I am reproducing it here for posterity and full attribution.\n\n---\n\nBy Gopal K. Kapur\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003csmall\u003eComputerworld | JUN 21, 2004 7:00 AM PT\u003c/small\u003e\n\nEarly in my career, when I worked as an engineer, my boss had a process by which the engineering team was expected to report project status. He insisted that we use the following steps, in the specified order:\n\n1. **Punch line:** The facts; no adjectives, adverbs or modifiers. "Milestone 4 wasn\'t hit on time, and we didn\'t start Task 8 as planned." Or, "Received charter approval as planned."\n2. **Current status:** How the punch-line statement affects the project. "Because of the missed milestone, the critical path has been delayed five days."\n3. **Next steps:** The solution, if any. "I will be able to make up three days during the next two weeks but will still be behind by two days."\n4. **Explanation:** The reason behind the punch line. "Two of the five days\' delay is due to late discovery of a hardware interface problem, and the remaining three days\' delay is due to being called to help the customer support staff for a production problem."\n\nNotice the almost reverse order of these points in comparison with the common reporting style in which team members start with a long explanation of why things went wrong. Using the four steps described above, the project manager learns the most important information first, then he learns supporting information to help complete the story.\n\nAt first, reporting this way wasn\'t a comfortable thing to do. It forced us to get to the point quickly and not resort to obfuscation. But not only did I learn to practice this style of status reporting at the office, I also taught it to my children.\n\nIt was put to the test a few years later. It was past midnight, long after the time my son Raj, then 17 years old, should have been home. He was new to driving, and it was a stormy night. His mother and I were anxious and concerned about his well-being. Finally, the phone rang. It was Raj, and he said, "Dad, I\'m OK; the bull is dead."\n\nThank God my son was fine, but the comment about the dead bull intrigued me. We didn\'t own a bull. Where was he? How did the bull die? And why was he telling me about it?\n\nThen he said, "The car is damaged but operable."\n\nAll right. He had gotten into some type of accident, the car wasn\'t a total loss, and there was a dead bull (still a great puzzle). I wondered whether our car insurance covered dead bulls.\n\nHe then explained about the location of the accident and informed me that a person nearby had called the police and that he (Raj) had taken a few pictures of the accident scene.\n\nAt this point my wife woke up and asked, "Is that Raj, and is he OK?" I told her, "He is OK; the bull is dead." This got her attention, and she was now wide awake.\n\nThough a bit angry that Raj was so late coming home and that he had gotten into an accident, I was impressed by his calm demeanor and his ability to keep his wits about him. Raj went on to say, "You don\'t need to rush. I\'ll explain when I see you." I hung up the telephone and began to get ready to drive to the scene of the accident.\n\nAt this point my wife, still puzzled by the information she had, inquired about the details. I repeated to her, "He is OK, the bull is dead, and he will explain the details when I get there." A bit annoyed, she said, "This is one of your punch-line things, isn\'t it?"\n\nI was greatly impressed by Raj\'s succinct way of giving me the right information in the right detail without going into unnecessary explanations. In journalism, this is known as the inverted pyramid style, which begins with the conclusion, followed by the most important facts and, finally, the details. This contrasts with academic writing, which opens with a problem statement, elaborates on the background, discusses influencing factors and finally states the conclusions. When the academic approach is used to give project status reports, people who are still awake for the punch line are silently praying, "Please, God, kill me now." That\'s precisely why I start with the punch line.\n\nFor many project team members, starting with the punch line can be disconcerting, but we have found that once they become accustomed to it, they truly enjoy the clarity of the message and the time saved in getting the point across.\n\nTry it, you\'ll like it.\n',

        '\nAs of this writing, in early 2019 Sears announced it is near liquidation, with a $4.4B bid to keep operating. At the **same moment**, on the **same day**, Amazon.com is the most valuable company in the world with an $810 billion dollar valuation, or **184 times greater**.\n\nPrior to Amazon\'s founding Sears had everything going for it. Brand recognition and established customer base, check. Global supply chain, check. Top notch distribution operation, check. System and infrastructure to take orders and handling billing, check. Bricks and mortar stores in addition to catalog sales, check.\n\nUnfortunately for an incumbent, change is **much** harder than anyone ever imagines it to be.\n\n\u003e "...Most organisms are highly resistant to change, but when they die it becomes possible for new and improved organisms to take their place. This rule applies to social structures such as corporations as well as biological organisms: very few companies are capable of making significant changes in their culture or business model, so it is good for companies eventually to go out of business, thereby opening space for better companies in the future."\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003ccite\u003e\n\u003e   \u0026mdash; John Ousterhout, Stanford University ([My Favorite\n\u003e   Sayings](http://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/sayings.php))\n\u003e \u003c/cite\u003e\n\nThere is a huge gulf between the speed and agility of a digital start-up and a large, entrenched incumbent. Not only do enterprises lack the proper digital skills, they simply cannot respond fast enough to react. This inertia has a name - it\'s called the **Inertia of Enterprise Despair.** It is made of these components:\n\n1. Institutional Inertia\n2. Cost Allocation\n3. Risk Management\n4. Talent\n5. Security\n6. Outdated Paradigms\n7. Regulation\n8. Procurement\n9. Legacy Systems\n10. Change Control\n\n### 1. Institutional Inertia\n\nLarge incumbent enterprises exist because they **did things right**. They made good choices, hired good people and created outstanding products and services. The fact they were so successful under the old paradigms is exactly what makes it so hard to adapt to new ones.\n\nTransformation by consensus, or by occasional hackathon, will not work, because transformation is not iteration from a low baseline: it requires making fundamental changes to an organization’s structure and processes. Digital transformation is about **business transformation**. It involves making fundamental changes to the organization\'s core processes and workforce.\n\nEnterprises are realizing they are now becoming **software companies**, and the people running a software company need to know how to do that. Organizations that want to thrive in the digital age need to wield the political will to radically transform themselves, rather than adopting superficial solutions. They must redesign how they operate, redesign their internal structure, and re-staff. Given what we know about the challenges of organizational change this will likely fail.\n\nWhat works better is to create a "digital" organization that is segregated the parent company. This new organization can recruit the talent it needs and operate like a startup. The challenge is to make this new organization as separate as possible; it has to be able to choose what corporate functions it taps into, otherwise it is yoked to the same "chassis" as the parent.\n\nMany organizations have created in-house VC funds to seek out promising startups and take a stake in them to secure their digital future. This approach creates the maximum amount of independence and separation. This is the clearest way to compete on a level playing field with the "Industry+Tech" startups that plan to make you irrelevant.\n\n### 2. Cost Allocation\n\nPoor cost allocation models create all manner of suboptimal enterprise behavior. They create a sense of **helplessness** for the department receiving the allocation. Leaders on the receiving end feel they are unable to manage the allocation amount or service level. Maybe they would like a lower (or higher) service level and are willing to sacrifice (or pay) for the privilege. But there are typically limited options, generally "one price, one service level".\n\nWorse, the models that build up the costs to be allocated are only known inside the allocating organization and rarely reflect reality. If the organization receiving the allocation wants to "pull out" and buy the service from a third party they are usually told they can\'t because that would simply drive up costs for the remaining business units (same pie, bigger slices).\n\nLeaders conclude that if they can\'t change the allocation they can make damn sure to get the best possible service level. So they begin to beat on the organization supplying the service. This of course eventually ruins the working relationship between them and continues until all parties **thoroughly dislike each other**. It goes without saying that things do not move quickly or efficiently at this point because the parties stop speaking to each other, and in really bad cases they actively sabotage each other.\n\nCost allocations must be completely transparent, and both costs and service levels must be benchmarked against the market. The receiving organization must be given the freedom to opt out. Finally, the enterprise must recognize that many costs should simply not be allocated, especially for those centralized services that divisions or subsidiaries are forced to adopt.\n\n### 3. Risk Management\n\nRisk management is by definition meant to reduce risk, which also **by definition promotes the status quo**.\n\nEnterprises have well-developed risk management muscles, particularly in regulated industries like healthcare or financial services. Since technology is the basis for nearly all business processes within a financial services company, the Risk Management function is always very interested in the consequences of a significant IT failure/outage, or a data breach.\n\nThey are so interested that they become very involved in key functions like project delivery and change management. The effect of this involvement is **lots of documentation and meetings**, two things that are sure to slow anything to a crawl.\n\nLike some aspects of security, occasionally the risk management activities are referred to as "risk management theatre". It exists to show we have it, and it\'s primary purpose is management reporting. It is less clear if it truly averts risk - particularly "black swan" type risks. It is usually focused on issues that either occur regularly, or at least have already occurred in the past. It rarely anticipates issues that have never happened before, but of course those are the most important risks to avoid.\n\nThe financial crises of 2009 is a great illustration. Does anyone think Bear Stearns or Lehman didn\'t have a risk management function? Of course they did - they just didn\'t anticipate or understand the actual risks facing them.\n\nIt’s interesting how risk managers and internal auditors react to Black Swans. Typically swooping in after the outage, keen to bayonet the wounded, with a mandate to add more controls. Making damn sure to close the barn door after the horse has bolted.\n\nRisk Management should a) be skilled enough to actually have a conversation about IT architecture because that is what determines how resilient a company\'s technology really is, and b) figure out how to reduce their "friction" to a technology adoption - which they have zero incentive to do.\n\n### 4. Talent\n\nAn organization is only as good as it\'s people. Successful organizations start out with great people. Great people help build the company and many successful careers are built as the company matures. Over time the great people go on to other challenges, or they retire. New leaders must take the reins, usually people who grew up inside the company and respect the culture and track record that made the company successful. These people are **terrific choices for continuity**, and maintaining the status quo. Conversely if the market really changes, and the company has to reinvent itself, these leaders struggle.\n\nAs the company grows it will develop a strong HR organization with all the best intentions. The HR professionals will perform their duties with professionalism and dedication. Unfortunately through hiring practices and compensation practices **they will force the workforce to become "average" rather than exceptional**.\n\n#### Hiring Practices\n\nIn a startup the founders are usually A+ players who saw an opportunity and were potentially frustrated with the ability to go after it inside their former employers. These people recruit and hire the "A players" they know from within enterprises struggling under the yoke of the Inertia of Enterprise Despair. They don\'t spend a lot of time formalizing job descriptions or titles, they don\'t benchmark their salaries - **they just grab the best people they can and go for it**.\n\nConversely, in a large organization the process goes something like this:\n\n#### Step 1: Conduct a job analysis\n\nBasically, this step will allow the human resources manager, hiring manager, and other members of management to determine if we really need this new position and define what the new employee will be required to do in the new position.\n\n#### Step 2: Create a job description\n\nBefore anything else, the organization must first define exactly what it needs. Job analysis involves identification of the activities of the job, and the attributes that are needed for it. These are the main parts that will make up the job description. According to human resource managers, the job description is the “core of a successful recruitment process”.\n\n- **Define minimum qualifications**. These are the basic requirements that applicants are required to have in order to be considered for the position. These are required for the employee to be able to accomplish the essential functions of the job.\n\n- **Define a salary range.** The job must belong to a salary range that is deemed commensurate to the duties and responsibilities that come with the position. Aside from complying with legislation (such as laws on minimum wages and other compensation required by law), the organization should also base this on prevailing industry rates. For example, if the position is that of a computer programmer, then the salary range should be within the same range that other companies within the same industry offer. _(see how the concept of "average" sneaks right in?)_\n\n#### Step 3: Sourcing of talent\n\nUsually there is a rule that says the job must be offered internally first. This simply slows things down and wastes time - there is no reason why internal candidates cannot be evaluated in parallel with external candidates. In fact it makes more sense because you are looking at all possibilities rather than just candidates from a shallow pool - after all you want the best candidate right? Yet large companies have this speed bump. Once you review the internal candidates and politely tell them "no, but thank you for applying" (usually creating some form of ill will) you can move forward.\n\nIn a startup you hire the best people you know from places where you have worked or consulted. Talent is easy to spot when you work side by side (but difficult to uncover in a 60 minute interview). Assuming you can convince them to join, you pay whatever is necessary to get them because you know they are "A players".\n\nConversely, in a large company the hiring manager rarely does any sourcing at all - it is HR\'s job to go source candidates. Yet most people in HR don\'t truly understand the roles they are recruiting for, relying on the job description and salary band to source a few decent resumes.\n\n#### Step 4: Making of the job offer\n\nThe last step of the previous phase involves the selection of the best candidate out of the pool of applicants. It is now time for the organization to offer the job to the selected applicant.\n\nAssuming the person accepts, the new employee will still have to undergo pre-employment screening, which often includes background and reference checks. When all these pre-employment information have been verified, the employee will now be introduced to the team.\n\nMeanwhile, in the startup the "A player" has been on the ground for **two months and already built the first MVP product**.\n\n#### Compensation Practices\n\nAs a company matures and it\'s industry grows benchmarking becomes increasingly important to the management team. This is especially pervasive inside HR organizations in enterprises in mature industries.\n\nAll benchmarking is an imperfect science but compensation figures are collected annually by large HR consulting firms and then sold in the next budget/compensation cycle. This means the data is already stale and a year old when you get it.\n\nEnterprises all say they want the best people, yet they attempt to benchmark their compensation to the average of year-old stale data. True A players get offered jobs elsewhere and leave, and the enterprise is left with **average players at average compensation** - exactly what the process is designed to produce.\n\n### 5. Security\n\nIf you’re working on something significant in a large enterprise, such as a new product, or implementing new software, then it inevitably becomes necessary to get a ‘security sign-off’.\n\nProcesses around this vary, but essentially, one or more security experts descend at some point on your project and audit it. It’s a medieval trial by ordeal. You get poked and prodded in various ways while questions are asked to determine weaknesses in your story. There will likely be references to various \'security standards\' which in turn are enforced with differing degrees of severity.\n\n**The beatings will continue until the security weaknesses are identified** (I’ve never heard of there being none). The outcome is a report outlining the set of risks that have been identified. These risks may need to be ‘signed off’ by someone senior so that responsibility lies with them if there is a breach. That process in itself is arduous (especially when the senior management person doesn’t fully understand technology) and will be repeated on a regular basis until the risks are sufficiently ‘mitigated’ through further engineering effort or process controls.\n\nThe real issue is very few senior leaders understand technology security and **into the knowledge gap flows money and resources**. The result is "lots of security" with questionable real effectiveness, measurable increases in cost and schedule, and measurable decreases in productivity (and possibly the morale of capable engineers) across the company.\n\n### 6. Outdated Paradigms\n\n"What’s your oldest Excel spreadsheet still in use?" This question was asked recently in an online discussion group. A lively conversation ensued where people tried to outdo each other.\n\n\u003e "I just realized that a spreadsheet I use weekly was first created in 2004 and has been in constant use now for over 13 years!"\n\nThe winners (or losers depending on your perspective) were several organizations **still using spreadsheets from 1995**, the year that Excel began to take root with the launch of Microsoft Office for Windows 95. Hopefully they are now using a modern version of Excel. Yet these files — and the \'business logic\' they contain — are still working for them, some twenty-three years later.\n\nCan enterprises using spreadsheets from 1995 transform into digital winners? Will their employees be able to redesign the process from the ground up using modern technology. Unlikely.\n\n\u003e “You take the new thing and shove it into the old paradigm”.\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003ccite\u003e\n\u003e   \u0026mdash; Rob Wolcott, Professor of Innovation \u0026 Entrepreneurship,\n\u003e   Northwestern Kellogg\n\u003e \u003c/cite\u003e\n\n#### Agile-ish and Scrum-Theater\n\nMany companies embarking on ‘digital transformation’ are "consciously incompetent". They know what’s not working, and they know they have skill gaps and process issues, but are under the illusion that if they just adopt "the right process" it will save them. These companies frequently adopt an Agile or Lean process in name **but not in practice**. This is what’s sometimes referred to as agile-theater.\n\n![Agile-ish Manifesto](/assets/blog/img/agile_manifesto.jpg)\n\nIf your software team is the only Agile part of the product team, that’s agile-theater. If the product manager is from the technology team, that\'s agile theater. At this stage you’re probably gathering little or no market feedback. Product backlogs are prioritized around dev and engineering and not for customer value. Product teams are rushing to build solutions first before validating market value or product/market fit.\n\n#### You Must Start with a Product Vision\n\nWhy do you need a product vision? Because it simultaneously aligns your product with a customer pain point or need, while filtering out who on your team will stay and who will go.\n\nHere’s how that works. A product vision inspires some and scares others. While a company mission sets the purpose for why a company should exist, a product vision suggests a future state in all it’s glory. It’s a **great filter to motivate and activate the best in your supporters**. It’s also a great way to get fence-sitters to decide where their loyalty lies and possibly ‘get them off the bus’.\n\nIf your highest paid people are driving opinion then consider the impact on your transformation. If they lack the fluency and literacy required to guide the business through change then you’re not going to get far. The product vision and strategy must be owned by the person who is responsible for the product itself, not someone who sits at a higher level in the org chart. That person must be competent and understand "product/market fit" and get paying customers as fast as possible, and then iterate even faster.\n\nThere is no finish line. **Digital isn’t something to be achieved. It’s state of being.**\n\n### 7. Regulation\n\nRegulators have power derived from government. They are able to enforce fines, penalties, and changes to business structure or processes. They have the force of law and global enterprises fall under the regulatory regimes of many different governments. It quickly becomes a nearly impossible task to track global regulatory compliance.\n\nSo to ‘simplify’ things large enterprises often create a set of rules that cover all the regulations that **may ever apply to their business across all jurisdictions**. Those rules are generally the strictest you can imagine. Added to that, those rules are curated by the legal/compliance organization and develop a life and culture of their own within the organization **independent of the regulator** - such that they can’t easily be brought into question.\n\nThese rules become huge inhibitors of change. Regulators embrace paradigms that are rooted in the experiences of software built in previous decades - because that is what worked back then. And if you want to change that, it will itself likely take years and agreement from multiple parties who are unlikely to want to risk losing their job. So you can end up in a situation where you are forced to work in a way prescribed years ago by your internal legal and compliance team, which are in turn based on interpretations of regulations which were written years before that, all based on software development processes that were in vogue years before that!\n\nObviously, this slows things down further and makes change quite difficult. Want to bring development and operations closer together and form a "DevOps" team? Well that\'s not how we did it 25 years ago! Therefore it\'s not recognized as best practice by the regulators and would definitely be frowned upon.\n\n### 8. Procurement\n\nAs an enterprise grows up it suddenly wakes up one day and realizes there are 50 departments/divisions/subsidiaries all buying "widgets" and if it could just coordinate and consolidate all "widget spend" it would save money. The logical thing to do is to create a centralized purchasing function to acquire widgets at the lowest possible price.\n\nThere are so many ways in which this perfectly sensible idea goes wrong. The first of which is that the new head of widget procurement and the widget procurement officers and analysts all must justify their roles. It wouldn\'t make sense spending $1M annually to operate our widget procurement office while only saving $500k on widgets, would it?\n\nThe logical responses are:\n\n1. **Attempt to create more savings.** Let\'s squeeze the widget vendors harder, cut down the number of widget vendors so we have more leverage, commit to certain levels of widget spend, etc. If all goes well we will save even more money! However, the widget procurement process is now slower and less responsive to business needs. We may be saving on widgets but it may take months longer to buy widgets due to extensive negotiations. We now may be committed to buy a certain number of widgets - and if our needs change those savings may evaporate. We usually alienate our suppliers through this process so they have very little incentives to go "above and beyond" when called for. Finally, vendor consolidation may leave us more vulnerable to vendor risk. The fact our risk went up, our vendors don\'t like us anymore, and our agility went down, are very real costs, but unfortunately they are hard to quantify and therefore don\'t count.\n\n2. **Put the savings in a better light.** I have seen savings estimated off the "highest widget price" vs. the "average widget price". Or, based on what widget prices are expected to be in the future. Or, based on some external benchmark like "industry average widget price". Anything that can be used to make our savings figures look as good as possible. Is this cynical? Yes. Does it really happen? Yes.\n\n3. **Cast a wider net.** Are we not saving enough on widgets to justify a department of widget procurement? Easy - what other things do we buy that the procurement office can help with? This is where technology always comes into focus. Technology is a large spend in any enterprise and that makes it an attractive target. However, **buying technology is not the same as buying widgets.**\n\nFirst of all, technologists who are making big platform technology acquisition decisions have to look years into the future. Whatever decisions taken today will affect an enterprise for a long time. We have to meet with the vendors and understand their roadmaps. We must evaluate their underlying architecture. We must understand the ecosystem they operate in. This knowledge comes by building relationships with Value Added Resellers (VARs) and the vendors themselves.\n\nOnce we make a purchasing decision we expect the VAR, or occasionally the vendor, to help us with bringing the new technology online. We expect security advice, configuration support and advice, and deployment help. These services may not be explicitly called out, or priced in a bid, but they are very important and valuable. Success or failure may hinge on these services.\n\nWhat happens when procurement gets involved? First, they usually make sure that technical people have no direct control over the negotiation (or sourcing process). Second the relationships that technology has nurtured over time migrate to procurement, disconnecting the technology practitioners, and making it difficult for them to get the information they need to be effective going forward.\n\nWhat often happens is something close to this:\n\n- You go to senior person to get sign-off for a budget for purpose X\n- They agree\n- You document several options for products that fulfill that purpose\n- The sourcing team will take that document and negotiate with the suppliers\n- Some magic happens\n- You get told which supplier "won"\n\nThis process helps reduce the risk that someone has undue influence to push a particular vendor (there are strict rules around accepting so much as a coffee from a potential supplier), which is a good thing. On the other hand, this process does extend the timeframe and can add months.\n\nTo complicate matters further, sourcing might have its own preferred supplier lists of companies that have been vetted and audited in the past. If your preferred supplier isn\'t on that list (and hasn\'t made a deal with one on those list), the process will take even longer or stall.\n\nTo add insult to injury those "valued added" services your VARs used to provide are no longer provided because they were either squeezed out in the negotiations, or you have lost the relationship capital you formerly had.\n\n**The enterprise "saves money" by trading against the costs of delay, lack of agility, and treating supplies as adversaries instead of partners**. You didn’t get your twitter account by putting out an RFP for a "microblogging service" right? Enterprise software companies now actively work to circumvent procurement offices by keeping initial costs low or non-existent and delivering their software via a web browser. Once the software is established, it is likely some "enterprise features" will be required that are then expensive to acquire.\n\nOld school vendors who operate under a licensing model become predatory (examples: Computer Associates, Oracle, Adobe) with frequent licensing audits. If a company\'s procurement office is not sufficiently aligned with the IT organization these audits can be train wrecks.\n\nCentralized procurement is not required for contract language standardization. In most organizations, even those without centralized procurement, the contracts are still reviewed by legal. Legal can enforce standard contract language regardless of centralized procurement.\n\nSome risks can be managed by staffing the centralized procurement office with experienced technology procurement officers who act as "consultants" to the IT practitioners (so the vendor relationships are not disrupted). VAR services should be called out and valued. Time must be valued in some fashion - how do we expose the cost of delay against the potential for additional savings and make good decisions?\n\n### 9. Legacy Systems\n\nAll large enterprises have a base of legacy applications and code; plus legacy people, with legacy skills to care for them. New, younger employees view working on this stuff as career suicide and run as far away as possible. Unfortunately legacy applications are always at the heart of the enterprise\'s most basic business processes - after all they were so important they were the first automation projects in historical times.\n\nMore automation grew around them and integrated with those systems, taking into account their data structures and quirks. Then even more automation was layered on top of that, and later we added data warehouses, web architecture, and bolted on analytics. **Replacing legacy systems is like open heart surgery on an elderly patient - wonderful news when it works, but funeral arrangements must be made if it doesn\'t**.\n\n\u003e "If it ain\'t broke, don\'t fix it!"\n\nIt becomes nearly impossible to gain sponsorship to replace legacy systems because of the inherent costs and risks. What executive wants to sponsor a legacy system replacement when they can instead champion a new predictive analytics system or a brand new web site? So these systems lumber on like large ancient beasts, cared for and fed by a tribe that speaks "assembly", "VSAM", "JCL" and "COBOL" and communes with companies that were dominant when "I Dream of Jeanie" was on TV. Of course there is no current documentation of how the system works or what the system does - it exists only in the heads of the tribe members.\n\nCIO\'s talk about reducing "run" costs to free up resources for "change". Legacy systems usually have many years of intricate patching and modifications making them very brittle and difficult to change. Older hardware and software may require added compatibility layers to facilitate integration with "modern" hardware and software. All of this drives up the run costs. The key issue is how do you materially change your run costs without ever having the sponsorship, resources and political will to tackle the legacy systems? I suppose it\'s for the same reason that some of us smoke and are overweight; we know it\'s bad for us but somehow the will to change evades us.\n\nThe net effect is, like an athlete, the enterprise can run only as fast as it heart can beat and it\'s lungs can breathe. Legacy systems are not "real-time", but rather "batch", so the heart only beats once a day (or maybe several times per day). The large enterprise with legacy systems and software at its heart cannot keep up with younger, fitter rivals.\n\n### 10. Change Control\n\nIn an enterprise, especially in a regulated industry, there is always some kind of system that tracks and audits changes to ensure that changes don’t happen without due oversight. This is because auditors **love this kind of stuff**. To ensure "audit-ability" of changes there is a process:\n\n- Changes must be raised to the "change control board", which normally requires filling out an onerous form.\n\n- Then the form must be approved/signed off by anyone responsible for any area that may be impacted. So let\'s say we are making a network change. Since every service runs on top of the network, every person responsible for every service will have to sign off. In theory, the person signing off must carefully examine the change to ensure it is sensible and valid. In reality, most of the time trust relationships build up between change raiser and change validator which can speed things up.\n\n- There might also exist ‘standard changes’ or ‘templated changes’, which codify more routine and lower-risk updates and are pre-authorised. These must also be signed off before being deployed (usually at a higher level of responsibility, making it harder to achieve).\n\n- Then the compliance, risk and security officers have to weigh in and approve the change.\n\n- The the approved change will be reviewed and ratified by the change control board and only then can the change be implemented.\n\n- Changes are scheduled into predetermined change windows, but only so many changes can fit into any one window, and common wisdom is to not make too many changes at once, so some changes will be pushed to the next available window.\n\n- While in theory the change can be signed off in minutes, in reality change requests can take weeks or months as obscure fields in forms are filled out wrongly (‘you put the wrong code in field 44B!’), sign-off deadlines expire, change freezes come and go, and so on.\n\n- As a result there is sometimes the concept of an "emergency" change request that very senior people can approve and basically "push it through". However, very senior people don\'t like approving emergency changes and ask lots of uncomfortable questions.\n\nAll this makes the effort of making changes far more onerous than it is elsewhere, which **enforces the status quo.**\n\n#### References\n\n- [It’s Time To Get Real About Digital Transformation](https://medium.com/pminsider/its-time-to-get-real-about-digital-transformation-a268a186844d)\n- [Vision Driven Products](https://www.radicalproduct.com/)\n',

        '\nThere is a post from 2005 by [Benji Smith](http://www.benjismith.net/) in the old (and now closed) [Joel on Software Discussion Group](http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/?joel.3.219431.12). It\'s titled "Why I Hate Frameworks". But I know it as "the hammer factory" post. It\'s just brilliant, even 13 years later. I am reproducing it here for posterity in case the old Joel on Software Discussion Group ever disappears.\n\nDon\'t get me wrong. I use frameworks and libraries on a daily basis and appreciate them. They have the potential for massive, repeatable time savings. But there are always tradeoffs. My rule of thumb:\n\n- Library: you call it.\n- Framework: it calls you.\n\nNow here\'s Benji on why he hates frameworks:\n\n===\n\nLet\'s pretend I\'ve decided to build a spice rack.\n\nI\'ve done small woodworking projects before, and I think I have a pretty good idea of what I need: some wood and a few basic tools: a tape measure, a saw, a level, and a hammer.\n\nIf I were going to build a whole house, rather than just a spice rack, I\'d still need a tape measure, a saw, a level, and a hammer (among other things).\n\nSo I go to the hardware store to buy the tools, and I ask the sales clerk where I can find a hammer.\n\n"A hammer?" he asks. "Nobody really buys hammers anymore. They\'re kind of old fashioned."\n\nSurprised at this development, I ask him why.\n\n"Well, the problem with hammers is that there are so many different kinds. Sledge hammers, claw hammers, ball-peen hammers. What if you bought one kind of hammer and then realized that you needed a different kind of hammer later? You\'d have to buy a separate hammer for your next task. As it turns out, most people really want a single hammer that can handle all of the different kinds of hammering tasks you might encounter in your life."\n\n"Hmmmmmm. Well, I suppose that sounds all right. Can you show me where to find a Universal Hammer."\n\n"No, we don\'t sell those anymore. They\'re pretty obsolete."\n\n"Really? I thought you just said that the Universal Hammer was the wave of the future."\n\n"As it turns out, if you make only one kind of hammer, capable of performing all the same tasks as all those different kinds of hammers, then it isn\'t very good at any of them. Driving a nail with a sledgehammer isn\'t very effective. And, if you want to kill your ex-girlfriend, there\'s really no substitute for a ball-peen hammer."\n\n"That\'s true. So, if nobody buys Universal Hammers anymore, and if you\'re no longer selling all those old-fashioned kinds of hammers, what kinds of hammers do you sell?"\n\n"Actually, we don\'t sell hammers at all."\n\n"So..."\n\n"According to our research, what people really needed wasn\'t a Universal Hammer after all. It\'s always better to have the right kind of hammer for the job. So, we started selling hammer factories, capable of producing whatever kind of hammers you might be interested in using. All you need to do is staff the hammer factory with workers, activate the machinery, buy the raw materials, pay the utility bills, and PRESTO...you\'ll have _exactly_ the kind of hammer you need in no time flat."\n\n"But I don\'t really want to buy a hammer factory..."\n\n"That\'s good. Because we don\'t sell them anymore."\n\n"But I thought you just said..."\n\n"We discovered that most people don\'t actually need an entire hammer factory. Some people, for example, will never need a ball-peen hammer. (Maybe they\'ve never had ex-girlfriends. Or maybe they killed them with icepicks instead.) So there\'s no point in someone buying a hammer factory that can produce every kind of hammer under the sun."\n\n"Yeah, that makes a lot of sense."\n\n"So, instead, we started selling schematic diagrams for hammer factories, enabling our clients to build their own hammer factories, custom engineered to manufacture only the kinds of hammers that they would actually need."\n\n"Let me guess. You don\'t sell those anymore."\n\n"Nope. Sure don\'t. As it turns out, people don\'t want to build an entire factory just to manufacture a couple of hammers. Leave the factory-building up to the factory-building experts, that\'s what I always say!!"\n\n"And I would agree with you there."\n\n"Yup. So we stopped selling those schematics and started selling hammer-factory-building factories. Each hammer factory factory is built for you by the top experts in the hammer factory factory business, so you don\'t need to worry about all the details that go into building a factory. Yet you still get all the benefits of having your own customized hammer factory, churning out your own customized hammers, according to your own specific hammer designs."\n\n"Well, that doesn\'t really..."\n\n"I know what you\'re going to say!! ...and we don\'t sell those anymore either. For some reason, not many people were buying the hammer factory factories, so we came up with a new solution to address the problem."\n\n"Uh huh."\n\n"When we stepped back and looked at the global tool infrastructure, we determined that people were frustrated with having to manage and operate a hammer factory factory, as well as the hammer factory that it produced. That kind of overhead can get pretty cumbersome when you deal with the likely scenario of also operating a tape measure factory factory, a saw factory factory, and a level factory factory, not to mention a lumber manufacturing conglomerate holding company. When we really looked at the situation, we determined that that\'s just too complex for someone who really just wants to build a spice rack."\n\n"Yeah, no kidding."\n\n"So this week, we\'re introducing a general-purpose tool-building factory factory factory, so that all of your different tool factory factories can be produced by a single, unified factory. The factory factory factory will produce only the tool factory factories that you actually need, and each of those factory factories will produce a single factory based on your custom tool specifications. The final set of tools that emerge from this process will be the ideal tools for your particular project. You\'ll have _exactly_ the hammer you need, and exactly the right tape measure for your task, all at the press of a button (though you may also have to deploy a few _configuration files_ to make it all work according to your expectations)."\n\n"So you don\'t have any hammers? None at all?"\n\n"No. If you really want a high-quality, industrially engineered spice rack, you desperately need something more advanced than a simple hammer from a rinky-dink hardware store."\n\n"And this is the way everyone is doing it now? Everyone is using a general-purpose tool-building factory factory factory now, whenever they need a hammer?"\n\n"Yes."\n\n"Well all right. I guess that\'s what I\'ll have to do. If this is the way things are done now, I guess I\'d better learn how to do it."\n\n"Good for you!!"\n\n"This thing comes with documentation, right?"\n',

        '\nWeb development has evolved faster than nearly every other software engineering discipline. The pace of innovation has been relentless, and front-end developers are confronted with new frameworks, tools, and standards for “modern” web development **constantly**. Framework fatigue is real thing. Even the languages of the web (HTML, CSS, and ECMAScript) have gone through a major modernization effort (and the pace of change increased):\n\n- HTML \u003e HTML5 \u003e HTML 5.2\n- CSS 3 \u003e CSS 4 + SCSS, PostCSS, autoprefixer, etc.\n- ECMAScript 5 (2009) \u003e ECMAScript 2015, ECMAScript 2016, ECMAScript 2017, ECMAScript 2018\n\nThe positive aspects of all the "churn" in the web development ecosystem are some truly incredible innovations that have fundamentally changed web development to enable much richer, engaging, and performant web "applications".\n\nOne of the best things to come along lately are **progressive web applications**. Progressive web apps are "installable" and provide user experiences that combine the best of the web and the best of apps. They are useful to users from the very first visit in a browser, no install required. They are [responsive](/2013-12-31-responsive-design-vs.-mobile-first) to screen size, pixel density and orientation. They can load quickly (even _without_ an Internet connection), can have an icon on the home screen, and can run as an app with a top-level, full screen experience.\n\n\u003e By the way **this** blog is a progressive web app and has been for a couple years. Boom.\n\n#### A Progressive Web App is:\n\n- **Progressive** - Works for every user, regardless of browser choice because it\'s built with progressive enhancement as a core tenet.\n- **Responsive** - Fits any form factor: desktop, mobile, tablet, and whatever is next.\n- **Fast** - Responds quickly to user interactions with silky smooth animations and no janky scrolling.\n- **Reliable** - Enhanced with **service workers** to work offline or on low-quality networks.\n- **App-like** - Feels like an app rather than a website. More like a natural app on the device, with an immersive user experience.\n- **Fresh** - Always up-to-date thanks to the service worker update process.\n- **Safe** - Served via HTTPS to prevent snooping and to ensure content hasn\'t been tampered with.\n- **Discoverable** - Is identifiable as an "application" thanks to a W3C manifest and service worker registration scope, allowing search engines to find it.\n- **Engaging** - Makes re-engagement easy through features like push notifications.\n- **Installable** - Allows users to add apps they find most useful to their home screen on their phone **without using an app store**.\n- **Linkable** - Easily share the application via URL, does not require complex installation.\n\nThat is a lot to unpack. Let\'s start with the underlying technology that makes it possible.\n\n#### What is a Service Worker?\n\nRich offline experiences, periodic background syncs, push notifications — functionality that would normally require a native application are now part of the web-native experience. Service workers provide the technical foundation these features rely on.\n\nA service worker is a script that your browser runs in the background, separate from a web page, opening the door to features that don\'t need a web page or user interaction. Today, they already include features like push notifications and background sync. In the future, service workers might support other things like geofencing. A core feature is the ability to intercept and handle network requests, including programmatically managing a cache of responses. The reason this is such an exciting API is that it allows you to support offline experiences, giving developers complete control over the experience.\n\n#### Why TLS/HTTPS only?\n\nService workers give you powerful capabilities. For example you can hijack connections and fabricate responses. While you would use these powers for good (e.g. content caching, working offline), a man-in-the-middle might not. To avoid this, you can only register service workers on pages served over HTTPS, so we know the service worker the browser receives hasn\'t been tampered with during its journey through the network.\n\nYour site will also rank lower in Google’s search results if it is not served via TLS, and browsers like Chrome are flagging websites that do not have a secure connection. TLS is definitely part of the "modern" web.\n\nThe **not** modern web:\n\n![No TLS](/assets/blog/img/no-TLS.png)\n\n#### So how do you build a progressive, TLS-secured, **web application**- that gets **perfect** marks \u003csmall\u003e(Lighthouse, Qualys and Securityheaders.com\u003c/small\u003e) - over a **weekend** - and deploy it for **free**?\n\nYou must stand on the shoulders of giants. Seriously. This project uses the "giants" of modern web development:\n\n- React\n- Yarn\n- Babel\n- Webpack\n- node\n- SCSS\n- Prettier\n- Bootstrap\n- FontAwesome\n- autoprefixer\n- PostCSS\n- Etc.\n\nGiven all the tools and complexity, it might take days just to be able to configure a development environment, **or** you can just install `create-react-app`. You are up and running in about 35 seconds with **no build configuration** work.\n\n- `yarn start` runs your app in interactive development mode\n- `yarn test` runs your tests\n- `yarn build` builds your app for production\n\n"Yarn build" is magical. It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes (for cachebusting).\nBy default, it also includes a service worker so that your app is a **full progressive web app** that loads from local cache on future visits.\n\n**Voila! Your app is ready to be deployed.**\n\nMy app is very small at the moment. I required:\n\n- react-router (for page routing)\n- 6 react "pages" (mainly pure components)\n- 8 react components \u003csmall\u003e(presentational, dumb, pure, functional... pick your term)\u003c/small\u003e\n\nFor styling I used:\n\n- Bootstrap\n- FontAwesome\n\nIt was built over the course of a weekend. I am not a graphic designer, so please excuse the design.\n\nI deployed it using Google Firebase Hosting - deploying your app from a local directory to the web only takes one command. The real draw is that it\'s 100% free for my usage level - 1 GB of storage (huge in web terms), and 10 GB/month of data, plus a free SSL certificate!\n\n#### The Results ([veritedatascience.com](https://veritedatascience.com)):\n\n:thumbsup: Full source is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/dstroot/react-vds).\n\nPerfect Lighthouse scores:\n\n![Lighthouse](/assets/blog/img/Lighthouse_Report.png)\n\nA+ Qualys Score:\n\n![Qualys SSL Labs](/assets/blog/img/SSL_Labs.png)\n\nA+ Security Headers Score:\n\n![Security Headers](/assets/blog/img/security_headers.png)\n\n#### References\n\n- [Google: Progressive Web Apps](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/)\n- [Google: HTTPS as a ranking signal](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal.html)\n- [Firebase: Pricing](https://firebase.google.com/pricing/)\n',

        '\nA year ago I wrote about how big data, collected from social media sites, and machine learning was used to influence voting in the United States in [The man least likely to succeed in politics](/posts/2017-03-19-the-man-least-likely-to-succeed-in-politics/). Collecting big data, and more specifically social data about each of us, has been described as the "new goldrush". Yet many of us are unaware of how technology is enabling the use (and misuse) of our personal data. As a technologist I find this area fascinating and evolving rapidly.\n\nIn the article I discussed how the Trump campaign used a firm named Cambridge Analytica to identify potential voters and to influence them. It was shown that by harvesting and studying a person\'s Facebook profile and "likes" researchers can know them better than their spouse.\n\nNow, Facebook announced that it has suspended Cambridge Analytica over concerns that it and other parties improperly obtained and stored users\' personal information. Facebook admits it knew about this issue in 2015, prior to the election.\n\n\u003e In 2015, we learned that a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan lied to us and violated our Platform Policies by passing data from an app that was using Facebook Login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica, a firm that does political, government and military work around the globe.\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003ccite\u003e\n\u003e   \u0026mdash; Facebook, "Suspending Cambridge Analytica and SCL Group from Facebook", March 16, 2018\n\u003e \u003c/cite\u003e\n\nCambridge Analytica has gained attention for its work with the Trump presidential campaign as well as a campaign supporting Britain\'s exit from the European Union. Cambridge Analytica has been scrutinized for ties with Julian Assange/WikiLeaks and the Mercer family. Rebekah Mercer and her father, hedge-fund billionaire Robert Mercer, are part owners of Cambridge Analytica. The Mercer family is among the top Trump donors, and helps fund the conservative website Breitbart.\n\nConcurrently during 2015, Breitbart went from a medium-sized site with a small Facebook page of 100,000 likes into a force shaping the election with almost 1.5 million likes. By July, Breitbart had surpassed The New York Times’ main account in interactions. By December, it was doing 10 million interactions per month, about 50 percent of Fox News, which had 11.5 million likes on its main page.\n\nSteve Bannon introduced Cambridge Analytica (where allegedly he was chairman of the board) to the Trump campaign in mid-May 2016. During the campaign, Cambridge Analytica provided data, polling and research services. Mr. Bannon became the campaign’s chief executive officer in August 2016 and later joined the White House as a top strategist (He left the administration in August 2017).\n\nBack in 2015, prior to the election, we knew:\n\n- We had a multi-billion-person platform that competitively dominated media distribution.\n- That fake news and misinformation was rampaging across the internet generally and Facebook specifically.\n- About the Russian disruptive information operations.\n\nAll of these things were known by various parties and yet no one could quite put it all together: Facebook data was being harvested and "weaponized" to target voters, then Facebook (and Twitter\'s) platform was being used to disseminate false and misleading data. Facebook profited by taking a very big chunk of the estimated $1.4 billion worth of digital advertising purchased during the election.\n\nAfter the election Jonathan Albright, research director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University, pulled data on six publicly known Russia-linked Facebook pages. He found that their posts had been shared 340 million times. And those were just 6 of 470 pages that Facebook has linked to Russian operatives.\n\n### Why is Facebook acting now?\n\nIn December, Special Counsel Robert Mueller requested emails from Cambridge Analytica in connection with its investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, the Wall Street Journal reported. The Journal also reported the emails had earlier been turned over to the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told the Journal that ties between Cambridge Analytica and WikiLeaks were of “deep interest” to the committee.\n\nChristopher Wylie, a former Cambridge Analytica employee has come forward recently as a whistle-blower. He described the election influencing in stark terms:\n\n\u003e “We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.”\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003ccite\u003e\u0026mdash; Christopher Wylie, former Cambridge Analytica employee\u003c/cite\u003e\n\nThis raises new questions about Facebook’s role in targeting voters in the US presidential election. It comes only weeks after indictments of 13 Russians by special counsel Robert Mueller which stated they had used the platform to perpetrate “information warfare” against the US.\n\nIt is possible that either the House Intelligence Committee, or Robert Muller\'s investigation has determined conclusively that Cambridge Analytica used Facebook data to influence voters, hence forcing Facebook\'s hand to finally admit what it knew and suspend Cambridge Analytica from it\'s platform.\n\n### How do we control this?\n\nThe real point here is this is how Facebook is designed to work. Facebook is designed to help advertisers with profiling and micro-targeting. All Cambridge Analytica did was understand how Facebook works, and use it. Unless Facebook changes its business model, it will be used as intended, and in particular ways that influence politics.\n\nWhat is more, it is only going to get more effective. Facebook is gathering more data all the time – including through its associated operations in Instagram, WhatsApp and more. Its analyses are being refined and becoming more effective all the time – and more people like Cambridge Analytica are becoming aware of the possibilities and how they might be used.\n\nI believe this technology has outpaced our legal system, and proper and appropriate controls are being left to the platforms themselves, who clearly have an economic incentive to look the other way. It is time to shine a light on these practices and educate and protect our citizens. On March 18, Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-Minnesota) tweeted that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg should testify in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee and "It’s clear these platforms can’t police themselves":\n\n\u003cCustomTweet id=\'975158333446541312\' /\u003e\n\nIt is past due to create a legal framework that manages how our personal data is collected and used. A good framework would, at a minimum, address these points:\n\n- First, data collection must be disclosed in clear and plain language.\n- Second, the _use of the data_ must be disclosed. If our data is being used for marketing purposes, or political influence, those uses must be disclosed.\n- Third, it must be equally easy to opt out as it is opt in, at any time.\n- Finally, users must be immediately notified of any inappropriate collection, retention, and use of their data by third parties.\n\nEurope is far ahead of the United States. After four years of preparation and debate the EU enacted the "General Data Protection Regulation", known as GDPR. It is the most important change in data privacy regulations in the 21st century, and it is taking effect very soon, on May 25, 2018. GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and includes the concept of "Privacy by Design".\n\nAt it’s core, privacy by design calls for the inclusion of data protection from the onset of the designing of systems, rather than an addition. Consent has also been strengthened. Consent must be clear and distinguishable from other matters and provided in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. It must be as easy to withdraw consent as it is to give it.​\n\nIt\'s clear the US needs a similar regulatory structure as our current one is lacking in so many ways.\n\n_UPDATE 03/19/2018:_ [Facebook Executive Planning to Leave Company Amid Disinformation Backlash](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/technology/facebook-alex-stamos.html?hp\u0026action=click\u0026pgtype=Homepage\u0026clickSource=story-heading\u0026module=first-column-region\u0026region=top-news\u0026WT.nav=top-news) Alex Stamos, Facebook’s chief information security officer, plans to leave Facebook by August. He had advocated more disclosure around Russian interference of the platform and some restructuring to better address the issues, but was met with resistance by colleagues, said the current and former employees. In December, Mr. Stamos’ day-to-day responsibilities were reassigned to others.\n\n#### References\n\n- [Politico: Facebook suspends Trump-affiliated data firm over privacy concerns](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/03/16/facebook-cambridge-analytica-suspended-trump-campaign-468692?cid=apn)\n- [Facebook: Suspending Cambridge Analytica and SCL Group from Facebook](https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/03/suspending-cambridge-analytica/)\n- [WSJ: Mueller Sought Emails of Trump Campaign Data Firm](https://www.wsj.com/articles/mueller-sought-emails-of-trump-campaign-data-firm-1513296899)\n- [50 million Facebook profiles harvested for Cambridge Analytica in major data breach](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/cambridge-analytica-facebook-influence-us-election)\n- [How Trump Consultants Exploited the Facebook Data of Millions](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html)\n- [Facebook Executive Planning to Leave Company Amid Disinformation Backlash](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/technology/facebook-alex-stamos.html?hp\u0026action=click\u0026pgtype=Homepage\u0026clickSource=story-heading\u0026module=first-column-region\u0026region=top-news\u0026WT.nav=top-news)\n- [The Cambridge Analytica scandal isn’t a scandal: this is how Facebook works](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/camridge-analytica-scandal-how-facebook-works-harvesting-data-politics-trump-brexit-a8264051.html)\n- [Cambridge Analytica filmed suggesting bribes and sex workers to entrap politicians](https://www.channel4.com/news/cambridge-analytica-revealed-trumps-election-consultants-filmed-saying-they-use-bribes-and-sex-workers-to-entrap-politicians-investigation)\n- [The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://www.eugdpr.org/eugdpr.org.html)\n- [Making sense of the Facebook and Cambridge Analytica nightmare](https://www.engadget.com/amp/2018/03/19/facebook-and-cambridge-analytica-nightmare/)\n',

The bridge owner could allow all to pass freely. Or, the bridge owner could:\n\n- Only allow people who drive Ford cars to pass.\n- Ask for your personal information and then sell that data to others who want to advertise to people who visit the Library of Congress.\n- Force you to show what books you have checked out, and stop you from passing if you check out certain books.\n- Insert advertising into your books after inspecting them.\n- Make assumptions about you from the material you browse or check out. These assumptions about your age, religion, sexual preferences, etc. could be sold to others to use for advertising certain products, or targeting you with specific news stories.\n- Decide people of your race, color or religion are not allowed to pass.\n\nRegulation is needed to\n\n- **Protect Your Privacy**\n- **Provide Information Security**\n- **Promote access to all citizens**\n\n### References\n\n- [U.K. Digital Economy Act 2017](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2017/30/contents/enacted/data.htm)\n- [Wikipedia: Library of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Alexandria)\n- [US Lawmaker Behind Bogus \'Net Neutrality\' Bill Wanted ISPs to Edit Online News and Censor the Internet](https://gizmodo.com/us-lawmaker-behind-fake-net-neutrality-bill-wanted-isps-1821470823)\n',

        '\nDo you want to become invincible? I mean “rock solid”; impenetrable; bullet-proof? The answer is simple: strive to **be the truth**. The truth is real, enduring and invincible.\n\nIn every situation we should always be faithful to the "truth" of whatever it is we’re dealing with. This means:\n\n- Not dressing up a bad situation to look good\n- Always sharing threats as well as opportunities\n- Disclosing all relevant information\n- Avoiding political pressure to hide information\n- Introducing clarity from a confusing situation\n- Avoiding social pressure to hide the truth from others so they "feel good"\n\nThis is not easy or simple. At work we can find ourselves under pressure to dress things up, put the old corporate “spin” on it, hide problems. Sometimes we are even implored or instructed to do this so we don’t disrupt an initiative, or make someone look bad (the latter being the reason 99% of the time). I have definitely felt this pressure – you probably have too.\n\n\u003e The truth is rarely pure and never simple.\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003ccite\u003e\u0026mdash; Oscar Wilde\u003c/cite\u003e\n\nAt home and in our social lives it may even be more difficult to "be the truth". It feels like it may be simpler to tell those little white lies. I think there are ways to be both **truthful and sympathetic** to someone\'s feelings. Maybe the simplest example is a personal one - don\'t you want your friends to tell you when you have food stuck in your teeth? Don\'t you want honest feedback?\n\n### How do we know what is true?\n\nLies, good ones, are cleverly and discretely camouflaged. A lie will take truth and twist it around, just enough for it to retain the appearance of truth so it can infiltrate our mind undetected and unquestioned. Then it is able to alter and subtly change our beliefs. Once we have incorrect beliefs we may make bad decisions and head down paths we should not take. So how can we know real truth from "almost truth"?\n\nFirst, the more we believe we ‘know’ all about something, the more closed off we are to new information. We must learn to question and test the information we are ‘fed’ - both new and and what we think we already know. When questioned, lies will eventually unravel. However when the truth is questioned, it is made stronger. The key is we must be willing to question and dig a little deeper when our "spider sense" is tingling. Sometimes just taking a few minutes to check the validity of something with other sources is enough.\n\nMy whole life I grew up being told that eating carrots was good for my eyes and creates better night vision. The facts however are slightly different. First, it is true that a vitamin A deficiency will cause night blindness. What is **not true** is that an excess of vitamin A will give you superior night vision.\n\nSecond, carrots are not as good a source of vitamin A as we may think. Carrots contain Beta-carotene, which is a precursor to Vitamin A. The body converts Beta-carotene into Vitamin A, but other sources of Vitamin A such as liver and eggs contain preformed (retinoid) vitamin A which is the final (useful) form of the vitamin our bodies need. Beef liver has nearly **eight times** as much Vitamin A (in a more useful form) as a carrot. Among vegetables, a sweet potato has more Beta-carotene than a carrot.\n\nIt turns out the reason we believe that carrots are good for our eyes is a bit of "fake news" way back from World War II. In the Battle of Britain, in 1940, the British fighter pilot, John Cunningham, became the first person to shoot down an enemy plane with the help of radar. In fact, in WW II, he was the RAF\'s top-scoring night fighter pilot, with a total of 20 kills. Some pilots like Cunningham, were better at night. His nickname was "Cats\' Eyes". The RAF put out the story in the British newspapers that he, and his fellow night pilots, owed their exceptional night vision to carrots.\n\nPeople believed this to the extent that they started growing and eating more carrots, so that they could better navigate at night during the blackouts that were compulsory during WW II. But this story was a **myth invented by the RAF to hide their use of radar**, which was what really located the Luftwaffe bombers at night - not carrot-assisted super-vision. However this myth has propagated forward to this day.\n\nSo, things can change. Being the truth is also about adapting what we perceive as the truth when new information is presented. Holding on to an “old truth” when it is no longer true, perhaps to save face, is not really “being the truth”.\n\n### When we ‘be’ the truth, we’re protected by it\n\nIt’s easier to get this concept by demonstrating the opposite – what happens when we don’t tell the truth? When we fudge (even a little bit) - then we have to protect our “fudging” to avoid the embarrassment of being found out. We leave ourselves open to attack from anyone who knows the real unvarnished truth, from any angle. So our behavior becomes defensive. If you’ve been in this situation, you’ll remember how stressful and how destructive it is.\n\n- If you bend the truth you have to keep bending it. People can sense it and generally at some point they will recognize it.\n- If you’re truthful it might not always be what others want to hear, but expectations and situations can be managed. Reality can’t.\n- The truth builds trust – and in business as in life trust is the ultimate currency.\n\n### Why does “being the truth” makes us invincible?\n\nThe truth "is what it is". It is the actual, true state of the world. I can’t change the color of the sky, nor can I stop a project from being behind schedule, or my pants from being too tight (time to diet). When we "be the truth", our position on anything is clear, solid and defensible. Yes, we can (and will) be attacked for being truthful; but at least we have an internal compass to follow. Those who are not ready to deal with the truth may refuse it and try to debate it, and in the short run they may even succeed, but in the long run the truth cannot be denied.\n\n### Be invincible!\n\n“Be the Truth” - the truth is real, enduring and invincible. Adopt the principle of finding out and upholding the truth and hang in there. Eventually truth and honesty will be back in fashion, but don\'t be tempted to lie to gain your advantage because lies cannot build a lasting foundation.\n\n#### References\n\n- [Carrots \u0026 Night Vision](http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2005/10/26/1392430.htm)\n- [Wikipedia: Vitamin A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_A)\n',

        '\nIn every organization I have worked with managing user authentication and passwords was a huge challenge. The key issue was that the "old" password best practices were **failed attempts to fix the user, not the system**.\n\nIn order for passwords to be difficult to crack they should be both long and complex. Since people have a very hard time remembering long passwords we have accommodated shorter passwords - by adding rules to ensure a minimum level of complexity. Unfortunately this makes the resulting password challenging for a person to remember.\n\nLength is actually more relevant to cracking difficulty than complexity. For short passwords we can literally try every possibility, thus complexity does not even matter. It is **much better to have longer passwords** (with less enforced complexity), i.e. a "pass phrase". E.g. "ilovewatchingthesopranos" is much more secure than "Xc$1\u003e".\n\nWe also required users to change their passwords periodically. Why? Just in case their password was compromised because we lacked the sophistication to **know** if their password was compromised!\n\nEach time a password change was required it would cause a flood of service desk calls because the person would forget the new password and try multiple times resulting in a locked account. So we required then to change their password monthly, because we could not tell if their account was compromised, which would invariably cause a denial of service to our own employees.\n\nWe also worked hard to train our users not to re-use the same ID and Password across different systems. This was the proverbial straw that broke the camel\'s back. There is no way a human is going to remember unique, long, and complex passwords across the typical 200 or so sites they use.\n\nThis created the opportunity for "Password Managers" to remember our ID\'s and Password\'s for us. However that comes with its own risks - what if your password manager is hacked and **all your accounts are compromised?** There have been few security practitioners that were willing to say the overall risk was lower by using a password manager since it assumes responsible use of the password manager tool itself and that the tool chosen is as secure as possible. Nor have many companies been willing to accept any liability if they were to provide a password manager to employees and that tool was hacked. But if you use your own password manager many companies will no allow you to install your own software on company machines.\n\n### How do people cope with these challenges?\n\nThey resort to bad practices like:\n\n- Keeping the same password and adding the month as a prefix or suffix in those places that require monthly password changes.\n- Writing the password down (Tip: look for post-it\'s under the keyboard). Or keeping a spreadsheet of user IDs and Passwords...\n- Using the same ID and Password across multiple accounts. This is a **very bad** practice as it is certain that some of your accounts will be compromised and the attackers know this tendency and will try your credentials **everywhere** to see if they can get in.\n\nThere are many others, but in short we can say that if a person is not using a password manager then they are very likely to be using some set of questionable practices.\n\n### New Guidelines from NIST\n\nThe US National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) recently published its four-volume SP800-63-3 Digital Identity Guidelines. They make three new and different suggestions when it comes to passwords:\n\n1. **Stop it with the annoying password complexity rules.** They make passwords harder to remember. They increase errors because artificially complex passwords are harder to type in. And they don\'t help that much. It\'s better to allow people to use pass phrases.\n2. **Stop it with password expiration.** That was an old idea for a time when we were not sophisticated enough to know when a password was compromised. Today, don\'t make people change their passwords unless there\'s indication of compromise.\n3. **Let people use password managers.** This is how we deal with all the passwords we need.\n\nAll I can say is that it is about time we had some sane advice. These changes will have a huge positive impact on both overall security and end-user satisfaction.\n\n#### References\n\n- [NIST Special Publication 800-63-3](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-63-3.pdf)\n- [Stop Trying to Fix the User](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7676198/)\n- [Why Password Expiration is Bad](https://securingthehuman.sans.org/blog/2017/03/23/time-for-password-expiration-to-die)\n- [Why Password Complexity Rules are Bad](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-man-who-wrote-those-password-rules-has-a-new-tip-n3v-r-m1-d-1502124118)\n- [Changes in Password Best Practices](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2017/10/changes_in_pass.html)\n',

        '\nThe Second Amendment was passed fifteen years after the American Revolution, in 1791, as part of the Bill of Rights. This was just three years after the Constitution was ratified in 1788. The complete Second Amendment of the United States Constitution reads:\n\n\u003e A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\n\nJames Madison originally proposed the Second Amendment as a way to provide more power to state militias. It begins with the concept that states must have a strong militia to ensure their security: _"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State..."_. The Second Amendment concludes with the notion that people must have the right to bear arms as an extension of the state militia concept (e.g. "the people" who can be called upon for military service during a time of need).\n\nIt was deemed a compromise between Federalists — those who supported the Constitution as it was ratified — and anti-Federalists — those who supported states having more power. Recall that it took twelve years after the American Revolution for the Constitution to be ratified. During this time the states continued to govern themselves (the federal government didn\'t exist yet).\n\nThe ratification of the Constitution in 1788 established the federal government’s authority, and gave Congress the power to raise and support armies. Article 1 Section 8 of the United States Constitution, control of the army and the power to direct the militia of the states, was delegated to the federal Congress. The First Congress did not immediately act upon this provision, however, choosing instead to set up the State, War and Treasury departments and the judiciary, among other things.\n\nHowever on August 7, 1789, President Washington urged congress to establish “some uniform and effective system” for the military “on which the honor, safety and well being of our country so evidently and essentially depend.” It was not until September 29, 1789 (the last day of its first session), that Congress passed a bill empowering the president “to call into service, from time to time, such part of the militia of the states, respectively, as he may judge necessary.”\n\nBefore that time the federal government lacked military power. After the American Revolution the Continental Army was disbanded. Believing that **“standing armies in time of peace are inconsistent with the principles of republican governments and dangerous to the liberties of a free people,”** the U.S. legislature disbanded the Continental Army following the Revolutionary War, except for a few dozen troops guarding munitions at West Point, New York, and Fort Pitt, Pennsylvania.\n\nAs the federal government ramped up and began operating in 1789 the states felt their power and independence threatened. The states wanted assurances that they could "balance" federal power and they wanted the right to keep their militias. In turn, the federal government was dependent on the state militias for its military power.\n\n### The Militia Clauses\n\nAfter the Constitution was ratified in 1788, and the Bill of Rights was passed in 1791, the first Congress proceeded to spell out it\'s control over the state\'s militias.\n\nThe Militia Clauses in the Constitution gave Congress authority for "organizing, arming, and disciplining" the militia, and "governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States".\n\nThe first legislation on the subject was the Militia Act of 1792 which provided, in part:\n\n\u003e That each and every free able-bodied white male citizen of the respective States, resident therein, who is or shall be of age of eighteen years, and under the age of forty-five years (except as is herein after excepted) shall severally and respectively be enrolled in the militia, ... every citizen, so enrolled and notified, shall, within six months thereafter, **provide himself with a good musket or firelock**.\n\nIt seems clear both from the language in the Second Amendment as well as the political climate at the time that the Second Amendment was a balance of power issue between the states and the federal government. It had little or nothing to do with an individual citizen\'s rights.\n\n### Interpretations of the Second Amendment\n\nThere are two interpretations of the Second Amendment. One view interprets the amendment to mean it provides for "collective rights", while the opposing view is that it provides "individual rights".\n\n**Collective Rights**\n\nThe collective rights view of the amendment is that it gives each state the right to maintain and train formal militia units that can provide protection against an oppressive federal government. They argue the "well regulated militia" clause clearly means the right to bear arms should only be given to these organized groups. They believe this allows for only those in the official militia to carry guns legally, and say the federal government cannot abolish state militias.\n\n**Individual Rights**\n\nThose with the individual rights viewpoint believe the amendment gives every citizen the right to own guns, free of federal regulations, to protect themselves in the face of danger. The individualists believe the amendment\'s militia clause was never meant to restrict each citizen\'s rights to bear arms. Note that there is not a single word about an individual’s right to a gun for self-defense or recreation in Madison’s notes from the Constitutional Convention.\n\n### The Supreme Court\'s View\n\nScholars highlight the prefatory language "a well regulated Militia" to argue the intention of the Second Amendment was only to restrict Congress from legislating away a state\'s right to self-defense. Scholars call this theory "the collective rights theory." A collective rights theory of the Second Amendment asserts that **citizens do not have an individual right to possess guns** and that local, state, and federal legislative bodies therefore possess the authority to regulate firearms without implicating a constitutional right.\n\nOne of the first rulings came in 1876 in U.S. v. Cruikshank. The case involved members of the Ku Klux Klan not allowing black citizens the right to standard freedoms, such as the right to assembly and the right to bear arms. As part of the ruling, the court said **the right of each individual to bear arms was not granted under the Constitution**.\n\nTen years later, the court affirmed the ruling in Presser v. Illinois when it said that **the Second Amendment only limited the federal government from prohibiting gun ownership, not the states**.\n\nThe Supreme Court took up the issue again in 1894 in Miller v. Texas. In this case, Dallas\' Franklin Miller sued the state of Texas, arguing that despite state laws saying otherwise, he should have been able to carry a concealed weapon under Second Amendment protection. The court disagreed, saying the **Second Amendment does not apply to state laws**, like Texas\' restrictions on carrying dangerous weapons.\n\nAll three of the cases heard before 1900 cemented the court\'s opinion that the Bill of Rights, and specifically the Second Amendment, does not prohibit states from setting their own rules on gun ownership.\n\nIn 1939 the U.S. Supreme Court considered the matter in United States v. Miller. In that case, Jack Miller and Frank Layton were arrested for carrying an unregistered sawed-off shotgun across state lines, which had been prohibited since the National Firearms Act of 1934.\n\nMiller argued that the National Firearms Act violated their rights under the Second Amendment. The Supreme Court disagreed, however, saying "in the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or use of a \'shotgun having a barrel of less than eighteen inches in length\' at this time has **some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia**, we cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument." The Court then explained that the congress included the Second Amendment to ensure the effectiveness of the military.\n\nIt would be nearly 70 years before the court took up the issue again, this time in the District of Columbia v. Heller in 2008. The case centered on Dick Heller, a licensed special police office in Washington, D.C., who challenged the nation\'s capital\'s handgun ban. **For the first time, after 217 years, the Supreme Court ruled that despite state laws, individuals who were not part of a state militia did have the right to bear arms.** As part of its ruling, the court wrote, "The Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home."\n\nThe court would rule on the issue again two years later as part of McDonald v. City of Chicago, which challenged the city\'s ban on private handgun ownership. In a similar 5-to-4 ruling, the court affirmed its decision in the Heller case, saying the Second Amendment "applies equally to the federal government and the states."\n\nIn 2016, the Supreme Court again ruled on a right-to-bear-arms case, Caetano v. Massachusetts. The case involved a woman who was in possession of a stun gun for self-defense against an abusive ex-boyfriend. Because stun guns were illegal under Massachusetts law, the woman was arrested and convicted for possessing the weapon. The case made its way to the Supreme Court, which ruled that stun guns and, indeed "all instruments that constitute bearable arms," are protected under the Second Amendment.\n\nIn summary, for 217 years the Second Amendment was viewed by our highest court as regulating the preservation or efficiency of a "well regulated militia". Then in 2008, the view changed that **despite state laws, individuals who were not part of a state militia did have the individual right to bear arms.**\n\n\u003e "A fraud on the American public."\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003ccite\u003e\u0026mdash; Warren Burger, former Chief Justice, describing the idea that the Second Amendment gives an unfettered individual right to a gun on PBS in 1990.\u003c/cite\u003e\n\n### Our world has changed significantly the last 226 years\n\nThe late 1700\'s was a very different time from today.\n\n- The US military was based on the States loaning their militia to the federal government. In other words **there was no US military**.\n- Police forces and Sheriffs did not exist to protect citizens.\n- Most people lived in very rural areas and firearms were necessary for protection and for hunting.\n\nThings have changed dramatically since then!\n\n**Today the US military is the world’s largest employer.**\n\nWith about 1.4 million active-duty military personnel, 1.1 million National Guard and reserve personnel and 700,000 civilian personnel, the U.S. Department of Defense employs more people than any other organization in the world. By comparison, the world’s largest corporation, Wal-Mart, has about 2.2 million workers on its payroll. The Department of Defense is also a huge land manager, controlling approximately 30 million acres worldwide, an area bigger than Pennsylvania.\n\n**The United States budgets almost as much money for defense as the rest of the world combined.**\n\nIn 2013, the United States handed out $619 billion to the military, about as much as the next nine highest-spending countries combined and 37 percent of the worldwide total, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, which tabulates such numbers annually.\n\n**Today there are over 250 sworn police officers per 100,000 citizens.**\n\nIn 2008, State and local law enforcement agencies employed more than 1.1 million people on a full-time basis, including about 765,000 sworn personnel (defined as those with general arrest powers). Agencies also employed approximately 100,000 part-time employees, including 44,000 sworn officers.\n\nFederal police employed an additional 120,000 full-time law enforcement officers, authorized to make arrests and carry firearms in the United States.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2008, overall full-time employment by state and local law enforcement agencies nationwide increased by about 57,000 (or 5.3%). From 2004 to 2008, the number of full-time sworn personnel per 100,000 U.S. residents increased from 250 to 251.\n\n**Today\'s weapons were unthinkable in the 1700\'s.**\n\nWhen the Bill of Rights was passed men had stopped carrying rapiers only 40 years earlier, and guns became the weapon of choice for a duel. A true dueling pistol was officially standardized in 1777 as "a 9 or 10 inch barreled, smooth bore flintlock of 1 inch bore, carrying a ball of 48 to the pound." Often lavishly decorated, the pistols are made until dueling fell out of favor in the mid-1800s - about the same time that guns were becoming much more lethal.\n\nIt took **44 years** after the Bill of Rights for weapons technology to advance to the first Colt revolver. In 1835 Samuel Colt developed the first mass-produced, multi-shot, revolving firearms. Colt was the first to apply Industrial Age machining tools to the manufacture of firearms.\n\nThe Crimean War (1854-56) was the last war to use only muzzle-loaded guns. **65 years after the Bill of Rights**.\n\nIn 1873 the Winchester rifle was introduced - **82 years after the Bill of Rights**. Winchester rifles were affordable, and produced in such great numbers that it became known as "the gun that won the West."\n\nIt took a over a **hundred years** before the first automatic pistol was created by Joseph Laumann in 1892. The Borchardt pistol of 1893 was the first automatic with a separate magazine in the grip, and this remains the defining feature of handguns today.\n\nToday we have automatic weapons that can fire 950 rounds per minute and weigh less than 5 pounds. They are designed to fire ammunition that will penetrate body armor, comprised of 1.6mm titanium plates and 20 layers of Kevlar, out to 200 meters and beyond (for example the Heckler \u0026 Koch MP7A1).\n\nThe framers of our Constitution and Bill of Rights had no way to foresee two hundred years into the future to the kinds of firearms that exist today. Can you imagine what kind of weapons might exist in 2217, two hundred years from now?\n\n### Where do we go from here?\n\nFor whatever reasons we never revisited the Second Amendment, to either clarify it, or to make it relevant to the world as it is today. Yet things are very different now:\n\n- The political issues that the Second Amendment addressed are no longer relevant.\n- Firearms today are nothing like the muskets of the 1700\'s.\n- The reasons to own weapons are different today than in the 1700\'s. For one thing we have a standing military and police force now.\n\nIn hindsight wouldn\'t it have made sense that:\n\n- As the federal government built up it\'s own military capability, and therefore no longer relied on State militias, we should have clarified or modified the Second Amendment?\n- As federal, state, and local police forces were organized and expanded shouldn\'t we have considered curbing or reducing ordinary citizens right to bear arms?\n- As weapons and ammunition evolved from hunting and protection and became ever more lethal shouldn\'t we have responsibly curbed the types and numbers of weapons that private citizens could own?\n\nIsn\'t it time to look at this topic with fresh eyes and open minds? To have a real national debate about what types of weapons and ammunition we believe citizens should own?\n\n- Perhaps owning more than a few guns may not be in the public\'s best interest. For what reason should a private citizen own 50 assault rifles?\n- Perhaps owning certain types of weapons or ammunition may not be in the public\'s best interest? Do we want private citizens with tracer rounds, or rounds specifically designed to defeat body armor?\n- Perhaps it is reasonable to be concerned about certain individuals owning firearms. Do we want serial criminals or those with an active mental illness owning firearms?\n\nThe debate is not about banning gun ownership - rather it should be about how to responsibly manage modern firearm ownership in a modern society. Today it is much harder to obtain a license to drive a car that it is to own a firearm - where there is no "driver\'s exam". Is this really in the best interests of our country and our society?\n\n#### References:\n\n- [Cornell Law School: Second Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/second_amendment)\n- [Historical timeline of the development of modern weapons](http://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/technique/gun-timeline/)\n- [The Second Amendment \u0026 the Right to Bear Arms](https://www.livescience.com/26485-second-amendment.html)\n- [9 Things You May Not Know About the U.S. Armed Forces](http://www.history.com/news/9-things-you-may-not-know-about-the-u-s-armed-forces)\n- [Wikipedia: US Militia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia#United_States)\n- [Law enforcement in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_in_the_United_States)\n- [Heckler \u0026 Koch MP7A1](https://www.armsunlimited.com/Heckler-Koch-MP7A1-PDW-4-6x30mm-Submachine-Gun-p/hk-mp7a1.htm)\n- [How the NRA Rewrote the Second Amendment](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/05/nra-guns-second-amendment-106856)\n\n---\n\nImage Credit: **Dan Bilzerian’s Guns**\n\n\u003cspan className="text-sm"\u003e\nDan Bilzerian is a notorious gambler, would-be Navy seal and Instagram "influencer".

        '\nUsing my personal laptop from any coffee shop, I can:\n\n- Access my bank account(s)\n- Access my retirement and brokerage accounts\n- Use my credit card to buy things\n- Review my medical test results\n- Send love notes to my wife\n\nThese are the most sensitive and private things I can imagine, and I can do these things **securely from any untrusted network anywhere in the world**.\n\n### Why do corporate networks still exist?\n\nMost companies still have a separate corporate network, protected by firewalls, intrusion prevention/detection, dedicated administrators, VPNs, etc. Why is it that I can access information which is the most important, private, and precious to me, from any computer, via any network, **without all that extra cost, complexity, overhead, and effort?**\n\nEven before the Internet, there were corporate networks. These networks were designed the way medieval castles were designed; as fortresses. They were designed to keep the unwanted out, using a heavily fortified gate (e.g. a firewall - a single point of ingress and egress). Anyone outside is considered dangerous, and anyone inside is trusted. However, anyone who makes it past the drawbridge has the run of the place.\n\nNew technology emerged against medieval defenses - scaling ladders; battering rams; siege towers and various types of catapults including the trebuchet. However, the main reason that the medieval castle approach failed was it became impossible to keep expanding a stone perimeter around a growing population. Eventually people had to live "outside the wall".\n\n### Introducing the "Inside Out" corporation\n\nImagine a company that eliminates the traditional corporate network by turning "inside out" and making **all of it\'s systems and applications available directly over the Internet**. No more corporate network, no more employee VPNs. In other words, no more castle wall - instead employees live "outside the wall", much like people in modern cities.\n\nAccess depends solely on device and user credentials, regardless of a user’s network location — whether it is an enterprise location, a home network, a hotel, or a coffee shop. As a result, all employees, contractors, consultants, etc. can work productively and securely from any network without the need for a traditional VPN connection into a privileged corporate network. Even the concept of local vs. remote access goes away because **the user experience is identical**.\n\n#### The results:\n\n- **Better security**. Because **each service is secured and hardened**. This approach forces application security to be truly effective and not "security theater". When an attacker breaches a corporate network they may find very few internal connections are encrypted and packets can be sniffed easily - and internal services vulnerable to attack. This is called "Tootsie Pop" security - a hard outer shell and soft on the inside. However, using the inside-out model it would be difficult to breach even one service. Delivering services over the Internet requires **each connection to be secured by end-to-end encryption** via Transport Layer Security (TLS).\n- **Lower costs**. Lets make a couple simplifying assumptions. First, let\'s assume that eliminating the corporate network saves money. Let\'s also assume that making applications hardened so that they can be exposed to the Internet requires additional investment. For the sake of argument let\'s assume these costs offset each other (although later I will show how a "smart" reverse proxy could eliminate the need to change internal applications). If these costs offset why is it still less expensive?\n  - **Lower Risk** - Lower risk = lower cost. Securing a network is done to prevent information leakage. Put another way, companies evaluate the cost of security **relative** to the costs of a breach. If the risk of a breach is reduced, then the potential cost to a company is also reduced.\n  - **Higher Productivity** - It cannot be stated strongly enough how even small barriers of time add up to large costs. If it takes an employee 3 minutes to log in via a VPN before they can be productive the cost is not just three minutes of their time, rather it is the risk that they may not log in remotely **at all**. Those extra few minutes cause employees to think "I\'ll just do this tomorrow when I\'m in the office".\n  - **Lower Business Continuity Costs** - Business continuity becomes cheaper. If employees can work from anywhere then the need for specialized business continuity support for employees goes away.\n  - **Lower Technology Costs over Time** - The Internet is the most reliable technology ever created, and it is arguably the best value. It is nearly free and higher bandwidth costs less every year. The cost of deploying corporate applications over the Internet is only going to decrease over time, while the cost of managing and defending a corporate network is only going to increase.\n\n### Google calls the Inside-Out corporation "BeyondCorp"\n\n#### Google’s BeyondCorp Mission (2011-2017)\n\nTo have every Google employee work successfully from untrusted networks without use of a VPN.\n\n#### BeyondCorp Principles\n\nConnecting from a particular network must not determine which services you can access.\nAccess to services is granted based on what we know about you and your device.\nAll access to services must be authenticated, authorized and encrypted.\n\n#### High-level Components of BeyondCorp\n\n- User inventory\n- Device inventory\n- Security policy\n- Trust repository\n- Access control engine\n- Single sign-on\n- Identity-aware access proxy\n\nGoogle first wrote about the concepts behind the BeyondCorp initiative in 2014, in a paper titled [BeyondCorp: A New Approach to Enterprise Security](https://www.beyondcorp.com/pdf/43231.pdf). They wrote a follow up paper in 2016 titled [BeyondCorp: Design to Deployment at Google](https://www.beyondcorp.com/pdf/44860.pdf) that detailed their migration path and findings along the way. A third paper titled [BeyondCorp: The Access Proxy](https://www.beyondcorp.com/pdf/45728.pdf) goes into detail about a key component of the solution.\n\nBeyondCorp is now **used by most Googlers every day!**\n\n### How to turn Your company "Inside-Out"\n\nAs consumers of internet services we understand how to access web sites securely. However many of us struggle with too many different user IDs and passwords. Yet, most of us are familiar with the experience of logging in to one service like Netflix, via an identity and authorization provider like Facebook. Imagine logging into all your services and sites via a single identity!\n\nGoogle implements Single Sign On via [https://accounts.google.com](https://accounts.google.com). Once you are logged in, you will be able to access all your Google services like Gmail, YouTube, and Google Docs without entering your credentials again. Imagine having the same experience but with all your company applications.\n\nIn order to become an "Inside Out" company the most important thing is an effective **identity management/single-sign on architecture** and the second is an **identity-aware access proxy**.\n\n#### Identity Management, Federation and Single sign-on\n\nThe first thing needed is the ability to manage users and authorize those users to access corporate applications. This requires:\n\n- **Unified Directory**. We must begin with **a single repository of all users and user data**. Companies may have many sources of user data, with none of them actually being the superset of all user data. We need the ability to synchronize users with any number of directories, such as Active Directory, LDAP-based directories, Workday, or Google Apps.\n- **Simple Authorization Management** - It needs to be simple to grant a user in a specific department, with a defined role, access to the applications they need. This should be driven by HR meta-data so security and application access policies can be applied automatically.\n\nHere are some of the companies that specialize in turning organizations "inside-out":\n\n\u003ctable\u003e\n  \u003ctr\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e\n      \u003ca href="https://auth0.com/"\u003e\n        \u003cimg src="/assets/blog/img/auth0_logo.png" alt="Auth0" width="150" /\u003e\n      \u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e\n      \u003ca href="https://www.okta.com/"\u003e\n        \u003cimg src="/assets/blog/img/okta_logo.svg" alt="Okta" width="150" /\u003e\n      \u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003c/td\u003e\n  \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003ctr\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e\n      \u003ca href="https://www.onelogin.com/"\u003e\n        \u003cimg\n          src="/assets/blog/img/onelogin_logo.png"\n          alt="Onelogin"\n          width="150"\n        /\u003e\n      \u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e\n      \u003ca href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en.html"\u003e\n        \u003cimg\n          src="/assets/blog/img/ping_logo.png"\n          alt="Ping Identity"\n          width="150"\n        /\u003e\n      \u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003c/td\u003e\n  \u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003c/table\u003e\n\nInterest in this space is increasing rapidly. On Friday, April 7th, Okta went public and their shares jumped more than 38 percent!\n\n#### Identity-Aware Access Proxy\n\nAnother key component of BeyondCorp\'s solution is a fleet of HTTP/HTTPS reverse proxies that used to be called Google Front Ends (GFEs). GFEs initially provided load balancing and TLS handling “as a service.”\n\nBeyondCorp leverages the GFE as a logically centralized point of access policy enforcement. GFEs were enhanced to provide authentication, authorization, self-service provisioning, and centralized logging. The resulting "enhanced GFE" is called the Access Proxy (AP).\n\nAs a result, web applications behind the proxy don\'t have to have any identity or security built into them - it is "bolted on", or applied at the reverse proxy layer. Web applications can focus on serving requests and largely ignore the details of how requests are routed to them. **This means corporate web applications can be made available to employees via the Internet with no changes!**\n\nGoogle has made this **available as a free product** called the [Identity-Aware Proxy](https://cloud.google.com/iap/). It works like this:\n\n![Identity-Aware Proxy](/assets/blog/img/iap-lead_2x.png)\n\nBitly has also open-sourced a project called [oauth2_proxy](https://github.com/bitly/oauth2_proxy). which is described as "a reverse proxy and static file server that provides authentication using Providers (Google, Azure, Facebook, GitHub, and others) to validate accounts by email, domain or group".\n\nPut simply, it is a completely free and open source Identity-Aware reverse proxy. It can be deployed to make any web based application accessible via Oauth2 based authentication. I have configured it to use Github for authentication for access to the Traefik console of my Kubernetes cluster [here](https://traefik.thepishoppe.com).\n\n### Abandoning the castle\n\nGoogle is one the most intelligent companies that exists today when it comes to understanding and managing IT security, and they are aggressively implementing their BeyondCorp "Inside-Out" model because it makes them more secure.\n\nIsn\'t it time all companies decide to live "outside the wall"? The corporate perimeter security model is outdated and does not support today\'s modern mobile and geographically diverse workforce.\n\nHere are the main components summarized:\n\n\u003cStep\n  number={1}\n  title="Unified User Directory and Centralized Access Controls"\n/\u003e\n\nWe must have a single, unified repository of all users and user data and simple ways to control\naccess to corporate applications.\n\n\u003cStep number={2} title="Identity-Aware Proxy" /\u003e\n\nA "smart" reverse proxy is placed in front of internal applications, where policies handle\nauthentication and authorization in a consistent manner. The proxy is controlled through our\nUnified Directory and access controls.\n\n\u003cStep number={3} title="Perimeterless Architecture/Zero Trust" /\u003e\n\nBy making internal applications public facing, there is no longer the concept of a privileged\nnetwork as the primary gatekeeper. Every connection is encrypted, and every request is\nauthenticated and authorized based on changes in user status and device state dynamically.\n\n#### References\n\n- [BeyondCorp: A new approach to enterprise security](https://cloud.google.com/beyondcorp/)\n- [No Firewalls, No Problem for Google](https://threatpost.com/no-firewalls-no-problem-for-google/123748/)\n- [Fundamentals of the BeyondCorp ‘Zero-Trust’ Security Framework](https://dzone.com/articles/fundamentals-of-the-beyondcorp-zero-trust-security)\n- [Google leads the way out of the castle to the cloud](http://blog.code42.com/google-beyondcorp-leads-the-way-out-of-the-castle-to-the-cloud/)\n- [Bitly\'s Oauth2 Proxy](https://github.com/bitly/oauth2_proxy)\n- [Ditch your VPN, improve security and go to the cloud](https://www.blog.google/topics/google-cloud/how-use-beyondcorp-ditch-your-vpn-improve-security-and-go-cloud/)\n',

Nixon’s new club, the Orthogonians, was for the strivers, those not to the manner born, the commuter students like him. He persuaded his fellows that reveling in one’s unpolish was a nobility of its own...\n\u003e\n\u003e The Orthogonians’ base was among Whittier’s athletes. On the surface, jocks seem natural Franklins, the Big Men on Campus. But Nixon always had a gift for looking under social surfaces to see and exploit the subterranean truths that roiled underneath. It was an eminently Nixonian insight: that on every sports team there are only a couple of stars, and that if you want to win the loyalty of the team for yourself, the surest, if least glamorous, strategy is to concentrate on the nonspectacular—silent—majority. The ones who labor quietly, sometimes resentfully, in the quarterback’s shadow: the linemen, the guards, the punter. Nixon himself was exemplarily nonspectacular: the 150-pounder was the team’s tackle dummy, kept on squad by a loving, tough, and fatherly coach who appreciated Nixon’s unceasing grit...\n\u003e\n\u003e Nixon beat a Franklin for student body president. Looking back later, acquaintances marveled at the feat of this awkward, skinny kid the yearbook called “a rather quiet chap about campus,” dour and brooding, who couldn’t even win a girlfriend, who attracted enemies, who seemed, a schoolmate recalled, “the man least likely to succeed in politics.” They hadn’t learned what Nixon was learning. Being hated by the right people was no impediment to political success. The unpolished, after all, were everywhere...\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003ccite\u003e\n\u003e   \u0026mdash; Rick Perlstein: "Nixonland: The Rise of a President and the\n\u003e   Fracturing of America"\n\u003e \u003c/cite\u003e\n\n### The unpolished, after all, are everywhere.\n\nTrump reached out to those who are:\n\n- Less suspicious of patently false claims\n- Less willing to do their research and homework\n- Less tolerant of people of different races\n- Less tolerant of people of different religions\n- Less tolerant of female leadership\n- Less tolerant of "tree huggers"\n\n### How do you reach these people?\n\nMostly they no longer read the LA Times, the New York Times, or the Washington Post (many probably never did). They no longer watch the evening news with Dan Rather. Rather, they glance up from Snapchat to see who got the rose on The Bachelor.\n\nSocial media is how you reach these people. One consistent theme across both the Trump victory and the Brexit success was their use of "advanced marketing techniques". These campaigns utilized the power of emotion to drive their narratives and leveraged the complexities of Big Data to **direct those messages at segmented groups via social media with devastating effect.**\n\nOne connection between the Trump campaign and the Brexit campaign was the alleged involvement of communications firm Cambridge Analytica (CA) of which allegedly Steve Bannon was formerly chairman of the board.\n\nCambridge Analytica used psychometric profiling to identify potential voters and to inform their approach and rhetoric in reaching them. Psychometrics allows the utilization big data to assess vast numbers of people and construct personality profiles on each person in order to pinpoint individuals most likely to convert.\n\nCambridge Analytica claims to have **up to 5,000 data points per person** – and they’re talking about almost every person in the United States, plus many more worldwide.\n\n### How do you build a profile of a person?\n\nInterestingly, by studying a person\'s Facebook "likes" researchers can know them better than their spouse. Michael Kosinski, when researching at Cambridge University, created an experiment where he posted a free-to-access psychometric test online to gather small amounts of data to inform his data analysis. This test went viral on Facebook and Kosinski was able to draw some powerful conclusions from his study.\n\n\u003e “Kosinski continued to work on the models incessantly: before long, he was able to evaluate a person better than the average work colleague, merely on the basis of ten Facebook “likes.” **Seventy “likes” were enough to outdo what a person’s friends knew, 150 what their parents knew, and 300 “likes” what their partner knew.** More “likes” could even surpass what a person thought they knew about themselves.”\n\nWith 170 likes per person, Kosinski’s methods were able to predict the following attributes with the connected rates of accuracy.\n\n![Kosinski Research](/assets/blog/img/Facebook-research.png)\n\n### Can this information be used to influence voters?\n\nOne psychometric framework is known as The Big Five, or OCEAN. This approach is centered around summarizing an individual’s personality through relation to five key categories:\n\n![OCEAN](/assets/blog/img/ocean.png)\n\nWe know this methodology is employed by Cambridge Analytica as their CEO Alexander Nix is pictured here below giving a presentation with the Big Five methodology taking center stage as one of the ways of understanding data.\n\n![Alexander Nix](/assets/blog/img/Nix-presenting-research.png)\n\nA politician in a US election needs to appeal to more than 65 million people in order to win the election. You need to find people susceptible to your product or message and be able to convert them. This is where the psychometric emotional mapping techniques offered through the Big Five methodology can help.\n\n#### The Need for Cognition Scale\n\nAnother method to target voters is called the [Need for Cognition Scale](http://www.psy.ohio-state.edu/petty/documents/ncogscale.pdf). This method is used in psychometrics to measure “the extent to which individuals are inclined towards effortful cognitive activities”, or feel “a need to understand and make reasonable the experiential world”.\n\nThis scale is used to understand how big an impact emotions make upon an individual’s decision-making process. Persons **low** on the Need for Cognition Scale **tend to form their opinions based heavily on emotion.**\n\n\u003e Our research finds that Trump has attracted a disproportionate (and unprecedented) number of “low-information voters” to his campaign. Furthermore, these voters are more likely to respond to emotional appeals — whether about the economy, immigration, Muslims, racial relations, sexism, and even hostility to the first African American U.S. president, Barack Obama. They are the ideal constituency for a candidate like Trump.\n\u003e\n\u003e We define low-information voters as those who do not know certain basic facts about government and lack what psychologists call a “need for cognition.” Those with a high need for cognition have a positive attitude toward tasks that require reasoning and effortful thinking and are, therefore, more likely to invest the time and resources to do so when evaluating complex issues. Those with a low need for cognition, on the other hand, find little reward in the collection and evaluation of new information when it comes to problem solving and the consideration of competing issue positions. They are more likely to rely on cognitive shortcuts, such as “experts” or other opinion leaders, for cues.\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003ccite\u003e\n\u003e   \u0026mdash; Richard Fording and Sanford Schram: "‘Low information voters’ are a\n\u003e   crucial part of Trump’s support", Washington Post, November 7, 2016\n\u003e \u003c/cite\u003e\n\nVoters who score poorly on the Need for Cognition Scale **are easier targets to sell political ideas to.** They are the easiest group of floating voters to target and capture based on a emotional message, delivered or shared by somebody they trust.\n\n### Can Social Media be "weaponized" to exploit targeted voters?\n\nWe know there are millions of fake accounts and highly active bots on all the social media platforms. Since these companies are valued by the number of accounts they have, or the number of accounts acquired, or "active users", they have little incentive to block the creation of fake accounts and activity bots.\n\nItalian security researchers Andrea Stroppa and Carlo De Micheli, in a report released four years ago, in 2013, claimed that they found 20 million fake accounts for sale on Twitter. Jason Ding, a research scientist at Barracuda Labs, told NBC News that the number of Twitter accounts that were fake was "at least 10 percent, maybe more." Twitter, according to The Wall Street Journal, claimed in its Securities and Exchange Commission report that only 5 percent of its accounts were fake.\n\nThe people who run the fake accounts and the bot farms where you can buy followers on Twitter, or likes on Facebook, are no longer selling fake persona, they are now **selling political influence**. Why buy just buy fake followers on twitter when you can tweet some fake news and have thousands of retweets?\n\nBots can also be used to silence people with opposing views. An automated army of pro-Donald J. Trump chatbots overwhelmed similar programs supporting Hillary Clinton five to one in the days leading up to the presidential election, according to a report published Thursday by researchers at Oxford University.\n\nThe bots targeted people by a hashtag symbol, like #Clinton. Their purpose: to rant, confuse people on facts, or simply muddy discussions, said Philip N. Howard, a sociologist at the Oxford Internet Institute and one of the authors of the report. In some cases, the bots would post embarrassing photos, make references to the Federal Bureau of Investigation inquiry into Mrs. Clinton’s private email server, or produce false statements, for instance, that Mrs. Clinton was about to go to jail or was already in jail.\n\n_UPDATE 04/29/2017:_ [Facebook has published](https://fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/facebook-and-information-operations-v1.pdf) how clusters of fake accounts were used to disseminate and amplify "fake news" during the 2016 election cycle.\n\n_UPDATE 10/12/2017:_ [What Facebook Did to American Democracy](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/10/what-facebook-did/542502/?single_page=true) The Atlantic has published what is currently one of the best, in depth looks at how social media and Facebook specifically was used to influence our presidential election.\n\nQuotes from the article:\n\n\u003e The same was true even of people inside Facebook. “If you’d come to me in 2012, when the last presidential election was raging and we were cooking up ever more complicated ways to monetize Facebook data, and told me that Russian agents in the Kremlin’s employ would be buying Facebook ads to subvert American democracy, I’d have asked where your tin-foil hat was,” wrote Antonio García Martínez, who managed ad targeting for Facebook back then. “And yet, now we live in that otherworldly political reality.”\n\n\u003e Through 2015, Breitbart went from a medium-sized site with a small Facebook page of 100,000 likes into a powerful force shaping the election with almost 1.5 million likes. In the key metric for Facebook’s News Feed, its posts got 886,000 interactions from Facebook users in January. By July, Breitbart had surpassed The New York Times’ main account in interactions. By December, it was doing 10 million interactions per month, about 50 percent of Fox News, which had 11.5 million likes on its main page.\n\n\u003e A Guardian reporter who looked into Russian military doctrine around information war found a handbook that described how it might work. “The deployment of information weapons ‘acts like an invisible radiation’ upon its targets: ‘The population doesn’t even feel it is being acted upon. So the state doesn’t switch on its self-defense mechanisms,’” wrote Peter Pomerantsev.\n\n\u003e Jonathan Albright, research director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University, pulled data on the six publicly known Russia-linked Facebook pages. He found that their posts had been shared 340 million times. And those were six of 470 pages that Facebook has linked to Russian operatives. You’re probably talking billions of shares, with who knows how many views, and with what kind of specific targeting.\n\n\u003e Add everything up. The chaos of a billion-person platform that competitively dominated media distribution. The known electoral efficacy of Facebook. The wild fake news and misinformation rampaging across the internet generally and Facebook specifically. The Russian info operations. All of these things were known. And yet no one could quite put it all together: The dominant social network had altered the information and persuasion environment of the election beyond recognition while taking a very big chunk of the estimated $1.4 billion worth of digital advertising purchased during the election.\n\n_UPDATE 03/16/2018:_ [Facebook suspends Trump-affiliated data firm over privacy concerns](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/03/16/facebook-cambridge-analytica-suspended-trump-campaign-468692) Politico informs us that Cambridge Analytica has been suspended after Mueller requested emails from Cambridge Analytica’s Trump-affiliated employees in connection with the probe into Russian election meddling.\n\n_UPDATE 03/19/2018:_ [Facebook Executive Planning to Leave Company Amid Disinformation Backlash](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/technology/facebook-alex-stamos.html?hp\u0026action=click\u0026pgtype=Homepage\u0026clickSource=story-heading\u0026module=first-column-region\u0026region=top-news\u0026WT.nav=top-news) Alex Stamos, Facebook’s chief information security officer, plans to leave Facebook by August. He had advocated more disclosure around Russian interference of the platform and some restructuring to better address the issues, but was met with resistance by colleagues, said the current and former employees. In December, Mr. Stamos’ day-to-day responsibilities were reassigned to others.\n\n### Closing the Deal\n\nOnce a voter has been "sold", or converted, then “confirmation bias" takes over. Confirmation bias is the tendency people have to embrace information that supports their beliefs and reject information that contradicts them. Of the many forms of faulty thinking that have been identified, confirmation bias is among the best catalogued; it’s the subject of entire textbooks’ worth of experiments. If reason is designed to generate sound judgments, then it’s hard to conceive of a more serious design flaw than confirmation bias.\n\nHowever, people are not randomly wrong. Presented with someone else’s argument, we’re usually quite adept at spotting the weaknesses. Almost invariably, the positions we’re blind about are our own.\n\n#### References\n\n- [Massive networks of fake accounts found on Twitter](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-38724082)\n  [1 in 10 Twitter accounts is fake, say researchers](http://www.nbcnews.com/business/1-10-twitter-accounts-fake-say-researchers-2D11655362)\n- [What Marketers Can Learn from Trump About The Science of Persuasion](https://www.process.st/science-of-persuasion/)\n- [Who shares the story, not who reports the news, is what counts for casual readers](https://qz.com/937590/for-casual-us-readers-the-person-who-shares-a-story-on-social-media-counts-for-more-than-the-actual-news-source/)\n- [Project on Algorithms, Computational Propaganda, and Digital Politics](http://politicalbots.org/)\n- [Automated Pro-Trump Bots Overwhelmed Pro-Clinton Messages, Researchers Say](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/18/technology/automated-pro-trump-bots-overwhelmed-pro-clinton-messages-researchers-say.html?_r=0)\n- [How Pro-Trump Twitter Bots Spread Fake News](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/11/17/how-pro-trump-twitter-bots-spread-fake-news.html)\n- [Facebook under fire for fake news, but the platform will never take real responsibility.](https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/19/facebook-will-never-take-responsibility-for-fake-news/)\n- [Why Facts Don\'t Change our Minds](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/02/27/why-facts-dont-change-our-minds)\n- [Need for Cognition Scale](http://www.psy.ohio-state.edu/petty/documents/ncogscale.pdf)\n- [Sources of Trump Support: The Case of Low-Information Voters](http://urban.hunter.cuny.edu/~schram/trumplowinformationvotersfinal.pdf)\n- [‘Low information voters’ are a crucial part of Trump’s support](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/11/07/low-information-voters-are-a-crucial-part-of-trumps-support/)\n- [Information Operations and Facebook](https://fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/facebook-and-information-operations-v1.pdf)\n- [What Facebook Did to American Democracy](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/10/what-facebook-did/542502/?single_page=true)\n',

Regulation, combined with technology to rate the likelihood of image tampering, voice tampering, or a "deep fake video" plus information about the source of the content and some type of "truth quotient", or score, is needed. Since unregulated technology got us here, maybe regulated technology can restore balance. \n\nOtherwise, I am afraid our increasingly polarized country is going to continue down the path we are on - we are only fed the information we want to see, we have no way to judge the quality and accuracy of that information, and conflicting information is filtered from our view.\n\n### References\n\n- [Angela Merkel: internet search engines are \'distorting perception\'](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/27/angela-merkel-internet-search-engines-are-distorting-our-perception)\n- [Facebook Top Source for Political News Among Millennials](http://www.journalism.org/2015/06/01/facebook-top-source-for-political-news-among-millennials/)\n- [How liars create the \'illusion of truth\'](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20161026-how-liars-create-the-illusion-of-truth)\n- [Both Old and New Media Are Failing Voters](http://www.wsj.com/articles/both-old-and-new-media-are-failing-voters-1478216173)\n- [How the Internet Is Loosening Our Grip on the Truth](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/03/technology/how-the-internet-is-loosening-our-grip-on-the-truth.html)\n',

        '\nIn the 1770s Joseph Bramah created a lock that was vastly superior to any the world ever seen. Bramah believed it was 100% theft-proof. Bramah was so confident in his design that he published a pamphlet detailing exactly how it worked and he put it in the window of his London storefront, and painted on it a challenge:\n\n\u003e “The artist who can make an instrument that will pick or open this lock shall receive 200 Guineas the moment it is produced.”\n\nThen Jeremiah Chubb created the Chubb detector lock. The way Chubb’s lock worked was that if a lock picker tried to lift one of the tumblers up too high, a latching mechanism would trigger, causing the lock to seize up. When that happened, even the key wouldn’t open the lock. To reset the lock, the owner would have to put in a different key and rotate it in the opposite direction to reset the tumblers.\n\nThus, if lock owners went to unlock a chest, or a vault, or a front door, and found that their key didn’t work, they would know that someone had tried to get in—and that they had failed.\n\nFor 70 years, the names Chubb and Bramah meant “perfect security”.\n\nIn 1851, London was hosting The Great Exhibition—the first international exhibition of manufactured products. One of the attendees was A. C. Hobbs, an American locksmith. Back in the states, Hobbs had made a name for himself by showing bank managers that their locks could be easily picked, and convincing them to buy one of his. Hobbs was selling lots of locks.\n\nOn day one of the exhibition, Hobbs publicly announced that he would pick the Chubb detector lock — the one that stops working if you pick it incorrectly. It took Hobbs about 25 minutes. And the way Hobbs did it was to use the lock against itself.\nHe would pick it until he tripped the detector mechanism, causing the lock to seize up. That would give Hobbs information about how it worked, and then he would pick the lock in the opposite direction to reset the detector. He’d go back and forth firing and resetting the detector until the lock told him everything he needed to know about how to get it open.\n\nBut the Chubb detector lock was really just a warm up. The main event was the Bramah safety lock—the one with the challenge painted on it in gold lettering, which had been sitting Bramah’s storefront window for 70 years, unbeaten.\n\nAfter working on the lock for about 52 hours over the course of fourteen days, Hobbs opened it.\n\n![challenge lock](/assets/blog/img/bramah-challenge.jpg)\n\nOvernight, the feeling of perfect security had evaporated.

It was analogous to a military assault.\n\nGiven enough time and resources **any** security can be defeated. The main goal of security is to raise the time and resources required to an unreasonable level. But how do you really know how secure something is?\n\nLike mountain climbing, security can and should be rated/evaluated based on actual experience. Also like mountain climbing there are initial conditions that indicate a “tough climb” or an easy one.\n\n### Conditions for high security levels\n\n1. **The technology is widely deployed/adopted.** Note that being widely deployed does NOT mean the technology is secure (Windows XP was widely deployed). It simply means that we are more likely to have lots of data about its security performance. The more opportunities and incentives for attack will give us more data, which increases our confidence of it\'s "rating".\n2. **The technology or system is attacked frequently with great intensity.** Ideally because of being widely deployed, it would be used is places that expose it to attack. Ideally those attacks are unrelenting. This also increases our data about its security performance.\n3. **The technology is simple to install and configure.** Many supposedly "secure" systems are dependent on how they are installed, or post-install "hardening". Systems and technologies must be "secure by default" when installed and easily installed properly by non-specialists.\n4. **Open code base.** An open code base allows for infinitely many sets of eyes to review the code, and infinitely many developers to fix any vulnerabilities found. Open code bases do **NOT** mean the code is secure. However, there are generally fewer issues, and when issues are found they are addressed faster. They also tend to be widely deployed and tend to be less complex to install and maintain.\n5. **Bug Bounty Program**. Public, open [Bug Bounty Programs](https://bugcrowd.com/list-of-bug-bounty-programs) encourage vulnerability research in a responsible manner. As an economist by training I believe when the rewards for good behavior are there you tend to get good behavior. If not, only bad behavior is rewarded.\n\n### Conditions for low security levels\n\n1. **Not widely deployed** The less widely the technology is deployed and used the fewer opportunities we have to gather good data about it’s security profile.\n2. **Not frequently attacked, or successful attacks are generally not disclosed.** This goes hand in glove with the above point. One issue with vendor sofware used in specialized applications within companies is that successful attacks may not be recognized/known, and/or they may not be disclosed. This gives us low information quality about the actual security performance.\n3. **Difficult to install and configure properly.** ERP applications such as SAP are notoriously complex and difficult to install. The database has over 70,000 tables excluding Y and Z tables, the overall system takes days to setup by highly trained specialists. The attack surface is quite large. SAP may not be a good example because security is good by default and we rarely hear about successful breaches - but the risk in the complexity is real.\n4. **Closed code base** If you have to ask your vendor “is it secure?” then it’s not. Security isn\'t something you can provide an answer to unless you\'re selling snake oil. If the vendor says: “It\'s secure. We did not put in any back doors. We audited the code ourselves. There are not any kernel level hacks, root kits, or otherwise. This has been tested against a variety of anti-virus scanners and none of them flagged anything. We\'re very good. Please, please trust us.” then you should know that they are telling you what you want, or need to hear. You could read the [WinXP pamphlet](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb457059.aspx) on security back when it was released and it had endless bullet points about how secure it was. It was probably the least secure software in the history of computing based on actual attacks after the fact.\n',

        '\nThe Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation just released it\'s annual letter. I have come to look forward to these letters because I find them incredibly inspiring. This year instead of an annual update they are re-baselining and taking a fifteen year view of the future. As I read this year\'s letter I was simultaneously moved, inspired and awed by the scope their mission:\n\n\u003e "The lives of people in poor countries will improve faster in the next 15 years than **at any other time in history**. And their lives will improve more than anyone else\'s."\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003ccite\u003e\u0026mdash; 2015 Gates Annual Letter\u003c/cite\u003e\n\nThere are four pillars to accomplish this mission:\n\n1. Health\n2. Farming\n3. Banking\n4. Education\n\nMy daughter and I spent 10 days traveling in Uganda several years ago with our friends Jeff Jensen and his daughter Caroline. We traveled fairly extensively and visited a number of charitable organizations in and around Kampala and Gulu. It\'s hard to appreciate how far ahead we are economically unless you experience it first hand.\n\nOne of the places we visited was [Krochet Kids](http://www.krochetkids.org/) in Gulu. They are the largest employer of women in the area. They provide job training, a fair wage to lift them and their families out of poverty, and a positive family-oriented environment. On a side note you can buy their products in Nordstrom! This picture is "the factory" on the day we visited:\n\n![Children](/assets/blog/img/krochet-kids.jpg)\n\nAs you can see the women get to sit in the shade of large trees, children are welcome, and they are encouraged to socialize as they work. The women I met were very happy and grateful for the opportunity. However we found out that when the women got paid (cash - they do not have bank accounts) their husbands would take the money. Some husbands would go drinking or find other ways to spend the money unwisely. The women were not empowered culturally to resist.\n\nThe founders of Krochet Kids decided they needed to find a way to create a type of bank where the women could protect their wages. If they didn\'t bring home cash their husbands would not have access to it. The key was to find a way to allow them to save money in an account, and also possibly loan each other money. The Village Savings and Loans Association (VSLA) was born. Currently on any given week there is roughly $10,000 being saved in the VSLA. The VSLA now offers small loans to women in the group and collects and divides any interest incurred.\n\nWhat Krochet Kids discovered was that in some ways the most valuable service they provided was not "a job" but rather training and mentorship on personal budgeting, savings, loans and business management topics. One of their stated goals is now:\n\n\u003e To equip the women of Northern Uganda with the financial assets and knowledge to enter into the local economy and thereby end their dependence on humanitarian aid.\n\nWhen reading this year\'s Gates Letter Mobile Banking is one of the four pillars of the fifteen year plan. I have seen firsthand how empowering this can be.\n\n#### Sources\n\n- [Bill \u0026 Melinda Gates Foundation](http://www.gatesfoundation.org/)\n- [Krochet Kids](http://www.krochetkids.org/)\n- [Restore International](http://restoreinternational.org/)\n- [Bob Goff](http://bobgoff.com/)\n',

        "\nHaving done some user interface work over the break I discovered that my design approach was basically to:\n\n1. Look around the web for things that I liked and then proceed to 'borrow' their aesthetic.\n2. Leverage UX/UI frameworks such as [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) or [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/).\n\nCombining a framework with something I think \"looks cool\" is a quick win. I can get something created quickly that has an incredible amount of time and effort already baked in to making it usable, responsive and approachable. Given the very wide of use of these frameworks I suspect many others work this way, but also since users are used to seeing many sites built with these frameworks it creates sense of familiarity.\n\nI am definitely not a designer and usually this is a cerebral as I get when it comes to UX/UI design work but I decide to step back and think about what we were trying accomplish. For example what are the base principles that could guide us? I found some good material from [Nielsen Norman Group](http://www.nngroup.com/) that I want to share (I hope it's OK).\n\nNielsen's 10 Heuristic Design Principles:\n\n#### 1. VISIBILITY OF SYSTEM STATUS\n\nThe system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.\n\n#### 2. MATCH BETWEEN SYSTEM AND THE REAL WORLD\n\nThe system should speak the users' language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.\n\n#### 3. USER CONTROL AND FREEDOM\n\nUsers often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked \"emergency exit\" to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo.\n\n#### 4. CONSISTENCY AND STANDARDS\n\nUsers should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions.\n\n#### 5. ERROR PREVENTION\n\nEven better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.\n\n#### 6. RECOGNITION RATHER THAN RECALL\n\nMinimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate.\n\n#### 7. FLEXIBILITY AND EFFICIENCY OF USE\n\nAccelerators -- unseen by the novice user -- may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.\n\n#### 8. AESTHETIC AND MINIMALIST DESIGN\n\nDialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.\n\n#### 9. HELP USERS RECOGNIZE, DIAGNOSE, AND RECOVER FROM ERRORS\n\nError messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.\n\n#### 10. HELP AND DOCUMENTATION\n\nEven though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large.\n\nThe main area that I struggle with is keeping it simple and minimal. I tend to want to create \"Tony Stark\" approved interfaces, yet in the real world I strongly prefer clean simplicity. Check out this example from the retailer Victoria Beckham:\n\n![Victoria Beckham](/assets/blog/img/VICTORIA_BECKHAM.png)\n\nThe product is front and center and draws your eye. The navigation is minimal. The buying options are as limited as possible, you can only choose your size. Yet there is nothing missing - I can get more details if I want, or a size guide if needed. To me, this is oustanding UI/UX. It is clean, simple and usable, and it highlights the product and only the product. What is your ideal UI/UX?\n\n### References\n\n- [Nielsen Norman Group](http://www.nngroup.com/)\n- [Victoria Beckham](https://www.victoriabeckham.com)\n- [Userium](https://userium.com/)\n",

        '\nToday President Barack Obama has come out in favor of net neutrality in very public way. He lays out in no uncertain terms that he believes no cable company or access provider should be able to put limits on access to the Internet. In addition, he’s suggesting that the FCC recognizes access to the Internet as a basic utility, and something that Americans have a basic right to. This means no blocking, no throttling, more transparency and no paid prioritization.\n\nHere are the four principles quoted directly:\n\n- **No blocking.** If a consumer requests access to a website or service, and the content is legal, your ISP should not be permitted to block it. That way, every player — not just those commercially affiliated with an ISP — gets a fair shot at your business.\n\n- **No throttling.** Nor should ISPs be able to intentionally slow down some content or speed up others — through a process often called “throttling” — based on the type of service or your ISP’s preferences.\n\n- **Increased transparency.** The connection between consumers and ISPs — the so-called “last mile” — is not the only place some sites might get special treatment. So, I am also asking the FCC to make full use of the transparency authorities the court recently upheld, and if necessary to apply net neutrality rules to points of interconnection between the ISP and the rest of the Internet.\n\n- **No paid prioritization.** Simply put: No service should be stuck in a “slow lane” because it does not pay a fee. That kind of gatekeeping would undermine the level playing field essential to the Internet’s growth. So, as I have before, I am asking for an explicit ban on paid prioritization and any other restriction that has a similar effect.\n\nIt doesn\'t matter whether you are on the "red team" or the "blue team" - this is a noble goal and one I hope everyone supports. An open Internet benefits us all in a myriad of ways and allows a free and open exchange of ideas across society. I\'d urge you to read [The Greatest Gift We Ever Had](http://www.raptitude.com/2014/11/the-gift/). Key quote:\n\n\u003e ...honest, inclusive conversation across a society will reliably lead to equality and higher quality of life, in any place it is allowed to happen.\n\n### My Thoughts:\n\n- There is one principle missing: **No Content Modification.** ISPs should not be allowed to modify any of the content they transport. This prevents them from injecting beacons, tracking code, advertising, etc. into web content that they are entrusted to deliver. This is happening and it needs to be stopped.\n\n- "Government Regulation" is known to increase costs, and potentially reduce growth and innovation. All things being equal I am in favor of less regulation rather than more regulation. We need to tread carefully as we seek to increase regulation to protect openness (bit of an oxymoron isn\'t it?).\n\n- We have to think carefully about the paid access issue. Does "no slow lanes" also mean "No Fast Lanes"? What if I want an ISP to provide a service where I get premium access to YouTube content, or Netflix content? Should that be illegal?\n\n- It is not a requirement that ISPs block unlawful content, rather it is a prohibition on blocking lawful content. But a strong enough prohibition on blocking lawful content (e.g., one which provides consequences whenever lawful content is blocked, even if the intent was to block unlawful content and the lawful content just got caught up in the filter) actually reduces the incentive for ISPs to attempt to identify and block unlawful content, since attempting to do so but making a misidentification in the process can result in penalties. In other words access to child pornography, terrorist information, and illicit drugs could actually increase as a result (i.e. "the law of unintended consequences").\n\n### Here is President Obama\'s Video\n\n\u003cYouTube link=\'https://youtu.be/uKcjQPVwfDk\' /\u003e\n\n### Update\n\nAs someone who considers himself a Republican It saddens me that this issue has become so polarized along party lines.\n\n\u003cCustomTweet id=\'531834493922189313\' /\u003e\n\nThe only similarity to the Affordable Care Act is that Obama supports it.

        '\n### Let\'s Talk About Open Government\n\nPresident Barack Obama, on his first day in office in 2009, signed an executive order stating that all government information that did not have to be kept secret for security or privacy reasons should be made public. The administration also launched the Open Data Initiative to publish government data and the [data.gov](http://www.data.gov/) website to distribute the data.\n\n\u003e My Administration is committed to creating an unprecedented level of openness in Government. We will work together to ensure the public trust and establish a system of transparency, public participation, and collaboration. Openness will strengthen our democracy and promote efficiency and effectiveness in Government.\n\u003e\n\u003e _[President Barack Obama, January 21, 2009](http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/news/20090121/2009_transparency_memo.pdf)_\n\nHuge strides have been made by the "Open Government" movement. Today:\n\n- Citizens and government leaders alike now expect government data to be accessible, transparent and machine-readable.\n- Further, 67.9 percent of people surveyed believe that “Government data is the property of taxpayers and should be free to all citizens.”\n- By a margin of three to one people said they are more likely to vote for politicians who champion data transparency.\n\n### It\'s progressed far quicker than we expected\n\n1. The United States Government maintains its [Open Data Policy](https://github.com/project-open-data/project-open-data.github.io) on GitHub! Anyone can fork the policy, edit it, and submit a pull request to have their edits adopted in a fully open process, exactly like creating open source software.\n2. Open data is a global movement. More than 40 countries — from every region of the world and at every stage of development — have established open data initiatives. These nations are opening up all kinds of data sets to promote economic development, spark innovation, and find ways to make government operate better. India has released 3,500 data\n   sets, mostly of agricultural information. Singapore has shared 8,600 data sets\n   from 60 public agencies, and just this year Australian budget data was made available in machine-readable form.\n3. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has published a set of standards ([ISO 37120](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:37120:ed-1:v1:en)) that specifies the relevant metrics for city services and quality of life. This will let researchers and citizens evaluate any city based on a uniform set of metrics. Furthermore, ISO 37120 confirms and accelerates the momentum of the open data movement and now provides a common framework within which all cities can participate. It is a gateway to smarter cities (and citizens).\n4. Cities have embraced the open government movement and opened up their data to the public. Here are some examples:\n   - [Los Angeles City Metrics](https://performance.lacity.org/) and [DataLA (LA Data Portal)](https://data.lacity.org/)\n   - [New York City Open Data Portal](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/)\n   - [City of Boston Data Portal](https://data.cityofboston.gov/)\n\n### It has a far larger economic potential than we expected\n\n- The benefits of open data are self-reinforcing: they increase as individuals access the data and help to improve the accuracy and detail of the information available. As people see the value in the data they will use it to create innovation and growth. It also drives trust as government leaders and officials can now be more easily measured and held accountable.\n- A [report](http://www.omidyar.com/sites/default/files/file_archive/insights/ON%20Report_061114_FNL.pdf) by Lateral Economics and the Omidyar Network finds that, by implementing open data policies, G20 countries could increase their cumulative GDP by $13 trillion over the next five years, because open data attracts private infrastructure investment, creates jobs, strengthens tax systems, and fights corruption.\n- A report by [McKinsey \u0026 Co.](http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/business_technology/open_data_unlocking_innovation_and_performance_with_liquid_information) suggests that seven sectors alone could generate more than $3 trillion a year in additional value as a result of open data, which is already giving rise to hundreds of entrepreneurial businesses and helping established companies to segment markets, define new products and services, and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of operations.\n\n### A Few Words About Open Science\n\nScience can be broadly described as collecting, analyzing, publishing, reanalyzing, critiquing, and reusing data. Interestingly, the open data movement in science predates the Internet. The concept of open access to scientific data was institutionally established in the mid-20th century when the International Council of Scientific Unions (now the International Council for Science) established several World Data Centers to minimize the risk of data loss and to maximize data accessibility, further recommending in **1955** that data be made available in machine-readable form. [1](http://www.icsu-wds.org/organization)\n\nMuch like open government, there are some commonly held beliefs about making scientific data publicly available:\n\n- "Data belongs to the human race". Typical examples are genomes, data on organisms, medical science, and environmental data.\n- Open data enables open peer review, which in turn creates better science.\n- In scientific research, the rate of discovery is accelerated by better access to data.\n- Sponsors of research do not get full value unless the resulting data is made publicly available. Or, put another way, trust in sponsored research increases.\n\nAs a result has been a [strong backlash](http://thecostofknowledge.com/) to the current publishing practices and keeping scientific data behind paywalls. To date nearly fifteen thousand scientists have signed a petition for the right of authors to achieve easily accessible distribution of their work.\n\nIt\'s clear that that the concepts of open data benefit science, and the platforms we discuss below could be used to further the goals of open science.\n\n### What Open Data Looks Like\n\nGoals, metrics and discoveries must be transparent. Here are examples from city data:\n\n![Digital Playbook](/assets/blog/img/goals.png)\n\n![Digital Playbook](/assets/blog/img/goals_metric.png)\n\n![Digital Playbook](/assets/blog/img/open_data.png)\n\nDatasets supporting the goals, metrics and discoveries must be publicly available, along with other supporting data:\n\n![Digital Playbook](/assets/blog/img/data_catalog.png)\n\nPlatforms have sprung up to support the open government movement. [Socrata](http://www.socrata.com/) appears to have market leadership in this space and has a very complete vision of what an open data platform looks like:\n\n![Digital Playbook](/assets/blog/img/socrata.png)\n\n### The "Open Data" Corporation\n\nOpen data is fast becoming a defining theme for business.\n\n- We all know that data is essential for management decision-making and strategic insight.\n- Enlightened organizations understand that data is a strategic corporate asset and foundational to operational excellence.\n- Companies understand that internal clarity and efficiency requires "a single version of the truth", and making data accessible is one of the first steps on this journey.\n- Integrated data from open sources and social media now allows a 360-degree view of customers, suppliers, products and markets and can generate new product ideas.\n\nBut how many companies today are committed to open data across the enterprise, or know how to implement an open data initiative? Many organizations still behave as if data is a by-product of the systems that generate and use it, and nothing more. The data stays locked into those systems and is inaccessible to those without a seat license.\n\nSome organizations are "shy" about sharing actual business performance data openly with their employees. This breeds mistrust of course. Some departments may not like openly sharing their data and metrics (what _is_ the average time to resolve a customer complaint?). Some people like to hoard data, giving them power in the organization.\n\nThe idea that unlocking value requires open data, and open data deserves deliberate investment, resources, headcount, and technology support – just like a company’s other corporate assets – is starting to sound like common sense.\n\n#### Why not have an enterprise architecture that is defined by **data** instead of **services**?\n\nIn the past we have made several runs at enterprise architectures that were defined by services. Best known is "[Service Oriented Architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture)" (SOA) which defined services that performed self-contained units of functionality, such as retrieving a customer record. Services could then be combined and reused to perform business processes.\n\nSome challenges of this approach:\n\n- It went against the trend towards buying software instead of building it - if I buy SAP what services does it expose? Do I have to build my own services _on top of SAP_? If so, what happens when I upgrade SAP and the data model changes?\n- Service discovery and reuse are hard problems in large environments, and it is also hard to maintain coherence and integrity of services. Metadata is necessary, like a catalogue, to perform discovery of services.\n- Processes that require managing application or process "state" are difficult to build.\n- Initially there were many technical ways to build services - starting with Remote Procedure Calls (RPC), then Java Business Integration (JBI), Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and data distribution service (DDS) and Simple Object Oriented Protocol (SOAP), which led us to concept of "Web Services" and the Web Services Description Language (WSDL). In short, a mess.\n\nWhy not invert the concept of services and start with data? Instead of starting with the concept of a customer object and then designing services to update the object lets just buy some licenses of [Salesforce.com](http://www.salesforce.com/). Now I have all the "services" I need to manage customer data. The challenge is how do I share that data with other applications in the company, or people without Salesforce seat licenses?\n\nToday on the web we generally use the REST (REpresentational State Transfer) design pattern. This means that the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations are specified by using HTTP methods to create APIs. We can consume these APIs in applications or websites with technologies like AJAX. A catalog and metadata is necessary, and this catalog must be usable by both humans and machines.\n\nIn the example above we would use the [Salesforce REST API](https://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/api_rest/). If we were to take other datasets in the company, particularly those without REST APIs, and make them available in an online catalog like [Socrata\'s](http://www.socrata.com/) we then get a REST API "built-in". Now the data is both discoverable and usable anywhere in the organization!\n\nIt has been notoriously difficult to share and integrate data across an enterprise and using a data-centric approach and REST APIs may be an answer.\n\n### Other Benefits of Open Data in Businesses\n\n#### Leaders are more trusted\n\nWe know people are more likely to vote for politicians who who champion data transparency, but guess what? People are also more like to trust and follow leaders who who champion data transparency inside their organizations.\n\n#### Organizations perform better\n\nOpen data can, and should be, linked to strategic goals. Are your organizations goals transparent? Are the metrics supporting those goals transparent? Is the actual data of the performance of the company against those goals shared openly across the firm?\n\nToo many organizations create grandiose plans and goals that make for wonderful slideware. When it comes to tying them to hard metrics and then rigorously and publicly sharing progress many fall short. This means inside the organization the "chaos of competing priorities" continues and the company lacks focus and ultimately performance.\n\n#### Value is unlocked\n\n- Open data can bring fresh insights into how companies operate and help management identify and eliminate "the sand in the gears" and other barriers to productivity.\n- Companies can choose to share proprietary data to create benchmarks that can improve overall industry performance.\n- Using open data, such as customer discussions on social media, companies can refine product requirements and create new products and services.\n- Companies can even consider ways in which to monetize the value of their data.\n\n### A few words about information security\n\nYes, "open data" sounds like it runs counter to everything we have been taught about information security and the principle of "least privilege". To be clear, there is information in an organization addressed by privacy laws, HIPAA, PCI and various and sundry other laws and regulations. This data must (of course) be protected as prescribed - even so, having a record of the datasets involved and who "owns" them is actually useful for both open data purposes (because it makes the fact we have the data, and who owns it, visible even if the dataset itself is not exposed) as well as information security requirements - security begins with information ownership and knowing who can grant/revoke access to sensitive information.\n\nLets also keep things in perspective - the vast majority of data in most organizations is simply "internal data" and is not confidential or sensitive. Yet it is information that people need to perform their jobs and often they struggle to find it, or use stale data, because they just don\'t know where to go or who to contact for the information - sand in the gears of daily operations.\n\nFinally, REST API\'s are able to be secured, usually via a key or OAuth authentication strategy so that open data doesn\'t have to mean "openly accessible".\n\n## Summary\n\nThink about how open data could apply to your business:\n\n- Do you know what the key operational metrics of your company are?\n- How transparent are those metrics?\n- Do you know which datasets support those metrics?\n- Do you know all the data that is available in your company? Is there a catalog of datasets?\n- Do you know who is _responsible_ for the data (i.e. the data owner or steward)?\n- How accessible is the data?\n- Can data be explicitly shared, and when shared, can the dataset owner/publisher specify the role for each grantee - editor, viewer, etc.?\n- If data cannot be shared do we at least know who "owns" or is responsible for it?\n- Is it available for download in any reasonable format needed?\n- Is it accessible via an API so your internal developers can work with it?\n- Can your organization consume open data from outside sources easily and make it available across the company?\n\n_Sources:_\n\n- [A brief history of open data](http://fcw.com/articles/2014/06/09/exec-tech-brief-history-of-open-data.aspx)\n- [Project Open Data](http://project-open-data.github.io/)\n- [Open Government Initiative](http://www.whitehouse.gov/open)\n- [Obama Demands Open Government](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/01/on-day-one-obama-demands-open-government)\'\n- [Open data: Unlocking innovation and performance with liquid information](http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/business_technology/open_data_unlocking_innovation_and_performance_with_liquid_information)\n\n_Open Data Platforms:_\n\n- [Socrata](http://www.socrata.com/)\n- [Junar](http://www.junar.com/)\n\n_Cloud Datasets:_\n\n- [Freebase](http://www.freebase.com/)\n- [Knoema](http://knoema.com/)\n- [OpenDataSoft](http://www.opendatasoft.com/)\n- [Quandl](http://www.quandl.com/)\n\n_APIs:_\n\n- [Sheetlabs](https://sheetlabs.com/#/)\n',

        '\nI have been playing around with CoreOS to get a sense of how everything works. The vision of this project is incredible.\n\nCoreOS describes itself as _"a new Linux distribution that has been re-architected to provide features needed to run modern infrastructure stacks. The strategies and architectures that influence CoreOS allow companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter to run their services at scale with high resilience."_\n\nCoreOS displaces hypervisors and machine virtualization in favor of Docker and Linux containers. CoreOS uses Linux containers to manage your services at a high level of abstraction. A single service\'s code and all dependencies are packaged within a container that can be run on one or many CoreOS machines.\n\nClustering works across platforms, meaning there is no cloud vendor lock-in. For example, CoreOS runs on Amazon EC2, Rackspace, QEMU/KVM, VMware and OpenStack and your own hardware. Running a single CoreOS cluster on multiple different clouds or cloud + bare metal is supported and encouraged. This lack of lock-in is the reason why I have supported OpenStack and CoreOS takes this even further.\n\n#### We begin with concept of a large fleet of machines that start (and remain) exactly consistent at the OS level\n\n- First, think of CoreOS somewhat like you might think of a hypervisor today. It is the first layer you put down on bare metal, or as a virtual machine in a cloud. It is a "bare minimum" Linux-based OS that supports Linux LXC containers.\n- It is designed to run as a large fleet (hive?) of machines. It includes built-in primitives such as distributed locking and master election, plus key services necessary to manage the fleet of machines. (more on this later).\n- It is meant to always be consistent across machines.\n  - CoreOS utilizes an active/passive dual-partition scheme to update the OS as a _single unit_ instead of _package by package_.\n  - CoreOS also has the tenant of **automatically** updating itself. This avoids the issue of inconsistent state from machine to machine within a large cluster. Conceptually this is roughly like a self-updating hypervisor.\n  - Each machine has to acquire and hold a reboot lock before it is allowed to reboot. The reboot lock is held until the machine releases it after a successful update. The number of machines allowed to reboot simultaneously is configurable. The main goal to allow for an update to be applied to a fleet quickly, without impacting capacity for the services running on the cluster.\n\n#### Next, we have the concept that the fleet of machines is simply a single pool of compute resources\n\n- You treat your CoreOS cluster as if it has a single, shared init system - one giant systemd if you will.\n- Instead of running a service on a specific machine, services are submitted to the cluster via the cluster manager, fleetctl, which decides where they should run.\n- Your services/applications are in containers that act as small, ephemeral units that can easily migrate around a cluster of self-updating CoreOS machines.\n- It is smart enough to distribute services across a cluster using machine-level affinity or anti-affinity.\n- If your application consists of 5 containers fleet will guarantee that they stay running somewhere on the cluster. If a machine fails or needs to be updated, containers running on that machine will be moved to other qualified machines in the cluster.\n\n#### ... with a single, shared brain\n\n- CoreOS provides a distributed key value store called "etcd".\n- The etcd client runs on each machine in a cluster. etcd gracefully handles master election during network partitions and the loss of the current master.\n- Docker containers can read, write and listen to etcd over the docker0 network interface. With these three actions you construct extremely sophisticated orchestration to happen whenever etcd values change. An example of this would be listening for changes and then to reconfigure an upstream proxy when a new container of an application is started.\n- Since etcd is replicated, all changes are reflected across the entire cluster. Your application can always reach the local etcd instance at 127.0.0.1:4001.\n- Your applications can read and write data into etcd. Common examples are storing database connection details, cache settings, feature flags, and more. Let\'s say we\'re running a simple web app like Wordpress. Instead of hardcoding our database address with in the config file, we\'ll fetch it from etcd instead. It\'s as simple as curl-ing [http://127.0.0.1:4001/v1/keys/database](http://127.0.0.1:4001/v1/keys/database) and using the response within your DB connection code.\n\n### Summary\n\nSo now we have a hive of self-updating Linux hosts with a single, distributed init system (systemd and fleet) and a single shared brain (etcd). It looks something like this:\n\n![CoreOS in Action](/assets/blog/img/coreos-action.png)\n\nThis depicts eight containers (two load balancers and six api servers) being managed by "fleet" to run in various CoreOS hosts in the cluster, with shared access to etcd.\n\nMomentum is shifting this way rapidly. Earlier this month Rackspace announced [OnMetal](https://www.rackspace.com/blog/onmetal-the-right-way-to-scale/). Rackspace\'s OnMetal Cloud Service is the first of its kind. Using OnMetal you create machine instances using OpenStack APIs but, instead of being provisioned a virtual machine, you are provisioned **on physical hardware**. OnMetal servers are single-tenant, bare-metal servers provisioned via the OpenStack API and can be spun up as quickly as VMs.\n\nOnce OnMetal is live, you\'ll be able to provision CoreOS instances on Rackspace\'s OnMetalcloud. This combination gives you the ease of spinning up machines with the click of a mouse, the security of running CoreOS with automatic updates, and the raw horsepower of running on bare metal. Pretty impressive!\n',

        '\nThree driving forces of infrastructure efficiency in a large, distributed environment were:\n\n- **Data center consolidation** _(KPI: How many DCs do you have?)_\n- **Host virtualization** _(KPI: what percentage of your servers are virtual?)_\n- **"Cloud" in its various forms** _(KPI: How many servers are you still running?)_\n\nAssuming you have been aggressive you may not have any data centers left. You may be buying services rather than servers, and/or all of your remaining machines might be virtualized and hosted in someone else\'s data center. Now what?\n\n### Where is future infrastructure efficiency going to come from?\n\nPersonally I think the next wave of infrastructure efficiency will be driven by Linux container technology (LinuX Containers = LXC). The LXC container approach does **not** require a hypervisor - instead you run isolated "containers" on a Linux host.\n\nLXC provides operating system-level virtualization, but instead of creating a full-fledged virtual machine LXC containers leverage cgroups (control groups) to completely isolate application\'s view of the operating environment, including process trees, network, user ids and mounted file systems. Cgroups are a Linux kernel feature to limit, account, and isolate resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O, etc.) of process groups.\n\nThis work was started by engineers at Google and in late 2007 it was merged into kernel version 2.6.24. LXC also relies on other kinds of namespace-isolation functionality, which have been developed and integrated into the mainline Linux kernel since then. It looks something like this:\n\n![Docker](/assets/blog/img/dockervsvm.png)\n\n### Is LXC Technology Really Better?\n\nHere are some of the major benefits of Linux Containers from my perspective:\n\n#### Fast\n\n- Runtime performance at near bare metal speeds (typically 97+ percent of bare metal).\n- Management operations (boot, stop, start, reboot, etc.) in seconds or milliseconds.\n\n#### Agile\n\n- VM-like agility -- it\'s still "virtualization".\n- With VMs we often touted our ability to ship a machine "over the wire" since a virtual machine is basically just a large file. It also allows better business recovery scenarios where I can have a snapshot of my production machine(s) copied to a different datacenter at regular intervals. Guess what? LXC containers are an order of magnitude smaller!\n- Developers can essentially use the exact same containers as those deployed into production.\n\n#### Lightweight\n\n- Just enough Operating System (JeOS); include only what you need reducing image and container bloat.\n- Minimal per container penalty which equates to greater density and hence greater returns on existing assets -- imagine packing 100s or 1000s of containers on a single host node!\n\n#### Inexpensive\n\n- Open source -- free -- lower TCO.\n- Supported with out-of-the-box modern Linux kernels.\n- LXC hosting likely to drive the next wave of cloud products.\n\n#### Ecosystem\n\n- Growing in popularity -- just checkout the google trends for docker or LXC.\n- Vibrant community and numerous 3rd party applications (1000s of prebuilt images on docker index and 100s of open source apps on GitHub or other public sources).\n\n#### Benchmarks\n\n- Average boot time: LXC 1.5x faster\n- Average reboot time: LXC 18.9x faster\n- LXC CPU growth 26x lower than VM (per machine)\n- LXC Memory group 3x lower than VM (per machine)\n- LXC images 3.2x smaller than VM\n\n### Summary\n\nThe next wave of server density is likely to be driven by LXC technology instead of traditional VM technology. This technology may also increase further an organizations agility, developer productivity and even business continuity. However, LXC technology is not yet as mature or "manageable" as VM technology, but tools like Docker are developing quickly.\n\n_Sources:_\n\n- [KVM and Docker LXC Benchmarking with OpenStack](http://bodenr.blogspot.com/2014/05/kvm-and-docker-lxc-benchmarking-with.html)\n',

        '\nThis morning I saw a post on LinkedIn by Bob Sutton who is a Stanford Professor and Co-author of Scaling up Excellence. He discusses Adobe\'s move to abolish it\'s employee stack ranking system. After the system was eliminated, one Adobe employee noted that a feeling of relief spread throughout the company because the old annual review system was **“a soul-less and soul crushing exercise.”**\n\nStack-ranking was popularized by Jack Welch at General Electric _(which has since ended the practice)_. GE felt the discussions forced honesty. Stack ranking forces the discussion betweenn manager and employee to address at least one key question: "Tell me where I rank and tell me why." Some organizations go even further - terminating employees who fall into the bottom 5-10% each year.\n\nMy personal experience with systems like these is they force employees to play "Game of Thrones" at work. It doesn\'t drive teamwork, instead employees hoard information and act on their best interests. It also creates a culture where people are afraid to be innovative and take risks (because what if they fail?). The worst aspects may be the politics that arise, or the behaviors where people highlight failure and mistakes in others in order to make themselves look better.\n\nI think W. Edwards Deming characterized stack ranking better than I ever could:\n\n\u003e “It nourishes short-term performance, annihilates long-term planning, builds fear, demolishes teamwork, nourishes rivalry and politics. It leaves people bitter, crushed, bruised, battered, desolate, despondent, dejected, feeling inferior some even depressed, unfit for work for weeks after receipt of rating, unable to comprehend why they are inferior. It is unfair, as it ascribes to the people in a group differences that may be caused totally by the system that they work in.”\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003ccite\u003e\u0026mdash; W. Edwards Deming - Out of the Crisis (1986)\u003c/cite\u003e\n\n### Adobe\'s Changes:\n\n- No more annual reviews, but managers are expected to have frequent “check-ins” with employees to provide targeted coaching and advice. There is no prescribed format or frequency for these conversations, and managers don’t complete any forms or use any technologies to guide or document what happens during such conversations.\n- One of the main goals was to **subtract technology\\*** from the feedback process. Adobe didn’t want managers to hide behind forms and computers. Instead, managers should focus on having candid and open conversations with the people they lead.\n- Once a year, managers make adjustments in employee compensation. Managers have far more discretion over such decisions than in the past: they have nearly complete authority to allocate their budget among their charges as they see fit.\n- Employees are compensated based on how well they have met their goals - not on the "bell curve".\n\n### Adobe\'s Results:\n\n- Voluntary attrition at Adobe has dropped 30% - much of which used to happen right after annual reviews.\n- Involuntary departures have _increased_ by 50%. because the new system requires executives and managers to have regular “tough discussions” with employees who are struggling with performance issues — rather than putting them off until the next review cycle.\n- 78% of employees report that their manager is open to feedback from them, a sizeable improvement over past surveys.\n- Eliminated the cost of employee review tracking and management system.\n- Saved an estimated 80,000 hours of time from the 2000 managers at Adobe each year, the equivalent of 40 full-time employees. _(although I feel this is suspect assuming managers spend at least as much, and hopefully more, time giving employees informal feedback instead)_\n\n### Takeways\n\nCompanies who claim they want all "A" players and then force a bell curve on them are doing themselves a disservice. This is not an internally consistent approach, and demotivates groups of employees who really are all top performers. If you really want all top performers you need an approach that allows everyone to excel.\n\nIn addition you need a culture that top performers find enticing:\n\n- **A sense of purpose** - what is the mission of the company?\n- **Clear goals** - What am I expected to contribute? What are the "the rules"?\n- **Linkage of company success to personal success** - "A" players are competive and want to be on a winning team. They also want to be recognized for their contribution.\n- **Positive feedback** - "A" players are used to positive feedback loops. They don\'t respond well to negative feedback loops. Make sure you tell them how important they are and exactly where and how they are doing well, _then_ you can share how they can improve.\n- **"Listened to" and respected** - By definition "A" players are smart - listen to them! If an "A" player shares a great idea to improve the company and it is seriously considered and/or implemented they will feel great (and probably will come up with many more ideas).\n\n\u003e Surprise - a culture like this works for everyone!\n\n_Sources:_\n\n- [LinkedIn: How Adobe Got Rid of Traditional Performance Reviews](https://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20140206114808-15893932-how-adobe-got-rid-of-traditional-performance-reviews?trk=object-title)\n- [Business Week: Microsoft Kills Its Hated Stack Rankings](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-11-13/microsoft-kills-its-hated-stack-rankings-dot-does-anyone-do-employee-reviews-right)\n',

        '\nLast week, IBM announced that it was selling its low-end server business to Chinese hardware manufacturer Lenovo. The deal has been widely viewed as the logical result of the commoditization of x86-based servers, in much the same way PCs were commoditized a decade ago.\n\nThis week Microsoft announced it is joining the Open Compute Project and will “open source” its server designs, sharing them with the world at large. Microsoft joins Facebook, Google, Amazon, Bloomberg, Intel, Box and many others. Microsoft will be contributing designs for the servers that power global cloud services like Windows Azure, Office 365, and Bing.\n\nIt\'s clear that the server business is never going to be same. For Microsoft open source goes against it\'s DNA, and for IBM the server business was viewed as core not so long ago.\n\n### Billion Dollar Idea\n\nFacebook started this movement in 2011, when it open sourced its first server designs and founded the Open Compute Project. The aim was to foster a community who would share hardware designs and bootstrap a more efficient means of getting these designs built.\n\nNow, nearly three years later, the project lets Facebook crowdsource improvements to its infrastructure and **allows multiple vendors to produce identical equipment** which gives Facebook supply chain diversity. In addition there is no vendor "support" costs, and you self-insure against failure via redundancy. So your true investment is only the hardware and engineering talent necessary to operate it. This is a CIO\'s dream.\n\nToday at the Open Compute Summit, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that "In the last three years alone, Facebook has saved more than **a billion dollars** in building out our infrastructure using Open Compute designs."\n\n\u003e A Million Dollars Isn\'t Cool. You Know What\'s Cool? A **Billion** Dollars.\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003ccite\u003e\u0026mdash; Sean Parker in "The Social Network"\u003c/cite\u003e\n\nZuckerberg also noted that "In just the last year we’ve saved the equivalent amount of energy of 40,000 homes in a year, and saved the amount of emissions equivalent to taking 50,000 cars off the road for a year."\n\n### Next Up - Network Gear\n\nIn the recent past switches were black boxes with integrated data planes, control planes and feature sets from **a single vendor**. The cost for sufficient capacity and performance was prohibitive. The challenge of making changes made the network brittle and network engineers gun-shy.\n\nToday however merchant silicon has surpassed custom Applications Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). This in turn enables enterprise grade networking hardware from Original Device Manufacturers (ODMs) - bare metal network hardware.\n\nWhat becomes critical is the software layer to manage and operate the network. Google was an early driver of software defined networking on top of bare metal commodity hardware. They helped define OpenFlow and breathe life into this technology.\n\nThis area is rapidly maturing and today we see examples like Dell hoping to sell hardware and services through a partnership with Silicon Valley startup [Cumulus Networks](http://cumulusnetworks.com/).\n\nSo what is going to happen to Cisco? Wonder why they were [downgraded](http://www.valuewalk.com/2014/01/cisco-systems-inc-csco-downgraded-by-jpmorgan/) today by J.P. Morgan?\n\n### Trickle Down Effect\n\nAll of this innovation is benefiting corporate clients who will either have better, faster, less expensive cloud platforms to leverage, or by directly reducing cost and complexity in their own data centers. Saving energy and being "greener" is icing on the cake.\n\n### Sources:\n\n- [Wired: Microsoft Open Sources Its Internet Servers](http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2014/01/microsoft-open-compute-servers/)\n- [Open Compute Project](http://www.opencompute.org/)\n- [Techcrunch: Facebook Saved Over A Billion Dollars](http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/28/facebook-open-compute/)\n- [Open VSwitch](http://openvswitch.org/)\n- [Wired: Google’s Secret Switch](http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/04/going-with-the-flow-google/)\n- [Open Networking](https://www.opennetworking.org/)\n',

        "\nQuicken Loans and Warren Buffet announced a billion dollar prize for a perfect NCAA college bracket prediction. As Quicken Loans puts it:\n\n\u003e You read that right: one billion. Not one million. Not one hundred million. Not five hundred million. One billion U.S. dollars.\n\n### Why Give Away a Billion Dollars?\n\nMy first reaction when I heard this is \"where is the value?\". Companies award prizes all time and we know the reason this occurs is basic economics - which teaches us that the \"cost\" of the prize is less than the \"value\" the company derives from offering the prize. So what amount marketing, exposure or publicity is worth **one billion dollars?**\n\nThe details of the prize are actually $25 million dollars for 40 years. So we can reframe the question as \"What amount of addional loan volume must Quicken Loans generate to produce more than $25 million of additional profit annually?\" To get there we need to know the average revenue per loan and Quicken's profit margin. For example if we assume $1,500 revenue per loan and a $10% profit margin this means Quicken Loans would earn a profit of $150 per loan. So $25,000,000 / $150 = 166,667 loans (rounding up).\n\n### This All May be Moot\n\nIt's virtually impossible to predict a perfect bracket. The math is simple: there are sixty-three games so it's 2 to the sixty-third power. The odds of you filling out a perfect bracket are a staggering 1 in 9.2 quintillion.\n\n#### How big is that?\n\n- That's one billion, 9.2 billion times.\n- It's 500,000 times more than our $17 trillion national debt.\n\n#### But I'm a Brackets Wizard!\n\nIf you are really smart and know that No. 1 seeds always advance in the first round, or tournament champions usually have a top-four seed, or about Duke's dual advantage of having a legend like Coach K and never getting called for a blocking foul you may be able to cut the odds down to something more like 1 in 128 billion.\n\nGet schooled by DePaul math professor Jay Bergen:\n\n\u003cYouTube link='https://youtu.be/O6Smkv11Mj4' /\u003e\n\nUsing 1 in 128 billion odds, if everyone in the United States filled out a bracket, we'd see a perfect one **every 400 years**! ESPN which has run a tournament challenge for the past 16 years has **never had a perfect bracket in over 30 million entries** according to the network. I assume that many of the people filling those out are pretty smart.\n\n### True Genius!\n\nSo the true genius of this is the prize will almost certainly not be awarded thus the marketing, exposure and publicity is free! I initially puzzled over why Warren Buffet was involved but as a long time insurance executive he must have some sense of the actuarial odds on this. Brilliant!\n\n_Sources:_\n\n- [Quicken Loans](http://www.quickenloans.com/blog/quicken-loans-billion-dollar-bracket-challenge)\n",

        '\nAs a CIO in a large, publicly owned financial services company I held the responsibility of keeping our client\'s (and our organization’s) data safe and secure. As the economics of cloud services became compelling the largest hurdle to adoption was "potential security risks", by a large measure.\n\nLet me explain what I mean by "potential security risks". Recently Ben Fried, Google\'s CIO, made a [remark about Dropbox](http://allthingsd.com/20131010/google-cio-ben-fried-on-how-google-works/):\n\n\u003e “The important thing to understand about Dropbox,” Fried said, “is\n\u003e that when your users use it in a corporate context, **your corporate\n\u003e data is being held in someone else’s data center.**”\n\u003e\n\u003e _(Emphasis added)_\n\n### How Ironic\n\nIt\'s a problem just because your data is in someone else\'s data center? That doesn\'t sound good for Google\'s business model. Fried and Google now say that he misspoke. Fried says he meant that the real concern about Dropbox is [more around security](http://allthingsd.com/20131015/google-cio-ben-fried-clarifies-remarks-on-dropbox/):\n\n\u003e “Any third-party cloud providers that our employees use must pass\n\u003e our thorough security review and agree under contract to maintain\n\u003e certain security levels,”\n\n### Reading Between the Lines\n\nThe second statement is the "politically correct" one. However, the first statement is much closer to the truth in many organizations. What Fried was saying is that Google doesn\'t trust Dropbox as much as they trust themselves. Most organizations share this same intrinsic bias.\n\nThe reality is that security standards are slightly fuzzy. Internal IT organizations potentially see third party services (or "the cloud") as a threat to their livelihood so they highlight possible security risks of external providers while sweeping their own under the rug. Internal auditors, compliance staff, and risk staff like to look at things, interview people and document stuff. When a service is external they feel a bit left out. As a result many companies have higher standards for third parties than what they hold themselves accountable.\n\nClearly **both** Google and Dropbox are businesses that depend on trust. Consumers and businesses are willing to use, and pay for, IT services from these organizations as long as their information is protected and secure. Without this level of trust **neither** business would be viable (although one could argue that Google could still rely on it\'s advertising business).\n\n### Broader Implications\n\nTrust is also a key ingredient in making a financial services business viable. Why would I ever buy insurance, banking services or invest my savings via a company that I didn\'t trust? When the financial markets were impacted by the sub-prime debt crisis in 2008 the public view of financial services took a nosedive. Companies that were created to help you buy a home, save for college, your retirement, or protect you from loss were suddenly the bad guys. The result was [Occupy Wall Street](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_Wall_Street).\n\nIt became clear that to succeed in the future the financial services industry would need to rebuild it\'s image. Companies would need to zealously rebuild their brands as "trusted advisors". From an IT standpoint it is crystal clear that client and corporate data must be guarded and protected to prevent any loss as well as minimize the potential for damage to an organization\'s reputation. Additionally it is clear that movements like Occupy Wall Street and Wikileaks were targeting large financial services companies.\n\nThe response to this need for trustworthy computing by many companies runs along the same view expressed by Google\'s Ben Fried, namely we can\'t have our data "out there" in someone else\'s datacenter, under someone else\'s control because it\'s too risky.\n\nThere are some legitimate reasons for this view:\n\n- Concerns regarding legal discovery\n- Concerns regarding the ability to respond to regulators\n- Lack of clarity from the regulators\n- Lack of clarity regarding liability for lost of stolen data (or no liability!)\n\nHowever at the end of the day these are issues that can be addressed if we really want to capture the economic benefits.\n\n### Capturing the Benefits - The Contrarian View\n\nThis is where it gets interesting. I have made the argument that I think using tools like Google Drive or Dropbox **responsibly** is actually likely to be **more secure** than managing our data ourselves.\n\n#### Why?\n\n- Data security and trust are at the heart of the business for companies like Google and Dropbox - therefore it is funded properly.\n- More transparency. Many, many businesses are looking for holes or reasons not to use the service - in order to overcome this resistance the data security has to be really good, and well documented, and well audited.\n- It is tested daily by thousands of hackers.\n- It is "usable" security - meaning it is baked into the usability of the products rather than "bolted on" corporate IT security. This is important because users won\'t actively try to circumvent it. In the corporate world if you put too many restrictions in place people start emailing documents to their Gmail account so they can work on them at home. Not good.\n- Your reputational risk is **lower**. I will explain further below.\n\nNo amount of security in the real world is perfect. Therefore Dropbox, Google and your organization **will get hacked**. It\'s inevitable, and no matter where your data resides you will need to tell your clients and/or your employees if any personally identifying information was potentially accessed. You may also need to notify your regulators and others - so no real difference here.\n\nBut what will the headlines say? "Dropbox Security Breach" or "`Your Company Here` Security Breach"? I\'d rather not see the headline with my company\'s name.\n\nI believe the public is more understanding because they use these services too. If you had corporate data at Dropbox or Google and they were breached and you had to send notification to your clients you could explain that while you did your due diligence a security breach still occurred at one of your service providers. Further, you will scrutinize their response and switch providers and/or bring the data back internally if necessary.\n\nI would also argue the economics of scale-based cloud services are even more compelling than people realize for large companies:\n\n- Less internal IT cost (the most obvious savings)\n- Less IT oversight cost (internal audit, risk, compliance, external audit, etc.) These are significant costs in large, regulated organizations.\n- Less "prevention" cost - i.e. tools to prevent installation of Dropbox, audit or removal of the software, etc.\n- Higher productivity and a better overall user experience with leads to less user training and higher adoption. Imagine a user with an iPad grabbing a document for a meeting from Dropbox or Google drive vs. an internally cooked up solution that requires a VPN connection, less polished software, etc.\n\n### Summing Up\n\nSo it\'s **even less expensive than you think and potentially even more secure**. Therefore I am in strong agreement with Ben Fried\'s second, clarified statement.\n',

I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work.”\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003ccite\u003e- Thomas Edison\u003c/cite\u003e\n\nMany large organizations work exceptionally hard minimize risk. Ironically, by working so diligently to reduce risk they are paying for it anyway, and reducing innovation at the same time.\n\nFrom Joel Spolsky’s [Camels and Rubber Duckies](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/CamelsandRubberDuckies.html): _(with some minor editing)_\n\nSoftware is priced three ways: free, cheap, and dear.\n\n\u003e **Free:** Open source, etc. Many big companies are still\n\u003e apprehensive about open source. They want someone responsible\n\u003e with deep pockets who will take their call when something goes\n\u003e south. Open source feels risky because there is no one else to\n\u003e blame.\n\u003e\n\u003e **Cheap:** $10 – $1,000, sold to a very large number of\n\u003e people at a low price without a salesforce. Most shrinkwrapped\n\u003e consumer and small business software falls into this category.\n\u003e\n\u003e **Dear:** $75,000 – $1,000,000+, sold to a few big companies\n\u003e using a team of slick salespeople that do six months of PowerPoint\n\u003e meetings just to get one sale. The Oracle model.\n\nAll three methods work fine. Notice the gap? **There’s no software priced between $1,000 and $75,000.**\n\nThe minute you charge more than $1,000 you need to get _signoffs_. You need a line item in the budget. You need purchasing manager involvement and competitive bids and paperwork and approvals. So you need to send a salesperson out to the customer to do PowerPoint, with his airfare and $19.95 movies at the Marriott. The cost of making one successful sale is going to average about $50,000. If you’re sending salespeople out to customers and charging less than $75,000, you’re losing money.\n\nBig companies desperately want to avoid risk when choosing commercial software. In order to sell to them you need competent sales people who can spend weeks just to get a one hour meeting; People who understand how to build consensus and can “tick all the boxes” for security, compliance, internal audit, business continuity, etc.\n\nEnterprises protect themselves so well that they drive up the cost of enterprise software, some of which goes towards the cost of jumping over all the hurdles that they have set up to minimize risk.\n\nIs it worth it? \n\n## Controls gone wild\n\nRisk Management 101: “The cost of the control should never exceed the cost of the risk”. Where companies struggle is quantifying the risk adequately so they can estimate if the control is worth it. It\'s way too easy for people to over-estimate the risk, and under-estimate the cost of the control. Worse, there is no good mechanism to push back -- no senior executive will stick their neck out and say "we have too many controls!".  The employees grumble and point out how slow and bureaucratic the process is and executives will say "we have to follow the process". Later, of course, they will also say "we need to be more efficient".\n\nA relevant example is the software development process. It became a became a magnet for controls, a convenient framework for risk and audit folks to attach an ever-increasing burden of business and technology controls. A burden that digital companies had to shed to speed up delivery - so, along came Agile development. They said we need just enough controls in Agile to support going fast.\n\n## Embrace risk to lower cost and increase innovation\n\nIt seems counter-intuitive - but in many companies one way to **lower cost and increase innovation is to embrace a little risk**. Lower the hurdles. Lower the “shame” of failure and innovation can thrive.  Companies with too many controls, that won’t take risk and punish failure, tend to be the least innovative – and even worse **their costs aren’t any lower either.**',

        '\n\u003e The United Arab Emirates holds the largest biometric database in\n\u003e the world, the Emirates Identity Authority has announced. The\n\u003e population register of Emirates ID has over **103 million digital\n\u003e fingerprints and over 15 million digital facial recognition\n\u003e records**, which includes multiple records of each UAE resident,\n\u003e and digital signatures as of October 11, 2012, senior officials said.\n\u003e\n\u003e Dr. Ali Al Khoury, Director General of Emirates ID, said the\n\u003e authority has submitted an official application to the World\n\u003e Record Academy to recognize this record. Asked about the\n\u003e confirmation of the authority’s claims about the world record, an\n\u003e official spokesman of the authority told Gulf News on Sunday: "We\n\u003e have made worldwide surveys and inquiries with the similar\n\u003e official authorities and agencies of the world governments holding\n\u003e such databases and confirmed that our database is the largest. The\n\u003e World Record Academy also confirmed to us that no other government\n\u003e or authority has made a similar claim for such a record." 1\n\nThe question you should be asking yourself right now is “for what purpose?” What is the value of having it? Who has access to it? Why make it so publicly known?\n\nThe Emirates Identity Authority states the benefits are:\n\n- ID Card is mandatory for all citizen [sic] and legal residence [sic] 15 years [sic] and above\n- Identification and Verification as per International Standards\n- Protect individuals’ identity\n- Can be used to access Secure eServices\n- Provides Identity Information\n- Stores many ID applications in future\n- Prevents fraud \u0026 Identity Theft\n- Portable personal database\n\nNote the first _benefit_ listed is that it is mandatory for all people 15 years of age and older.\n\n### Let’s come up with some ideas of our own\n\n**Government Services:** This is the most obvious use. Governments collect taxes and provide services to their citizens. They need a simple, cheap, accurate way to identify you to prevent fraud. In the US we are familiar with the concept of people defrauding Social Security, Medicare, and many other government programs. Would a method that cuts down or eliminates fraud pay for itself?\n\nTake it a step further – Imagine if you went to access a government service and it recognizes you and verifies you are qualified to receive the service, yet it also determines you have not filed an income tax return in four years. What would we expect to happen?\n\n**Crime:** The information could be used to as a better way to fight crime. Imagine a country that has facial recognition records and fingerprints of all citizens. Let’s assume you commit a crime and are caught by conventional methods but lie about your identity – will you get away with it?\n\nNow imagine the country develops and deploys a video surveillance network in its major cities. I would imagine these tools could be used in a positive way to deter crime. It would lower the chance of false accusation of innocent people. People who have exhibited a pattern of crime could even be automatically and continuously monitored and tracked.\n\nMany people have seen the movie “Minority Report”. What if I told the United States is trying it out, for real? Our Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is betting on algorithms: it’s building a “prototype screening facility” that it hopes will use factors such as ethnicity, gender, breathing, and heart rate to “detect cues indicative of mal-intent.” DHS calls its “pre-crime” system Future Attribute Screening Technology, or FAST.\n\nDHS has conducted preliminary research in operational settings to determine the feasibility of using non-invasive physiological and behavioral sensor technology and observational techniques to detect signs of stress, which are often associated with intent to do harm. 2\n\n**Healthcare:** Imagine your health records are associated with your facial recognition records. Now imagine you have an allergy to certain medications and are involved in a car accident, or you have a heart attack. By scanning your face your medication allergies are known and you are administered the correct medication. Or imagine an elderly person with Alzheimer’s or other serious health issues and they wander off. Couldn’t this technology help find them and bring them to safety?\n\nPeople are starting to use technology to track their activity on a daily basis – Nike’s Fuel Band, Fitbit, and Jawbone all make personal biometric data collection devices that are meant to be worn 24×7 and track your steps, your sleep patterns and even your heartbeat. What if you shared this data with your healthcare provider? You may get lower healthcare premiums if you live an active lifestyle. Or what if your heart starts beating irregularly in your sleep – what if medical help was summoned on your behalf?\n\nAlso imagine for a moment your healthcare provider is your government and they have facial recognition capability. What if you are spotted regularly eating at pizza places and fast food restaurants? Might you receive a call from your healthcare provider urging more healthy choices?\n\nIs it just a coincidence that our National Institute for Health and our National Science Foundation just announced 15 million in new Big Data fundamental research?\n\n“To get the most value from the massive biological data sets we are now able to collect, we need better ways of managing and analyzing the information they contain,” said NIH Director Francis S. Collins. “The new awards that NIH is funding will help address these technological challenges–and ultimately help accelerate research to improve health–by developing methods for extracting important, biomedically relevant information from large amounts of complex data.” 3\n\n**Immigration:** It is easy to add surveillance of airports, train stations and ports and your passport/travel documents already have your name and photo, plus radio frequency ID tags (RFID). Fingerprint records are captured from you upon entry.\n“The U.S. Electronic Passport (e-passport) is the same as a regular passport with the addition of a small contactless integrated circuit (computer chip) embedded in the back cover. The chip securely stores the same data visually displayed on the photo page of the passport, and additionally includes a digital photograph. The inclusion of the digital photograph enables biometric comparison, through the use of facial recognition technology, at international borders. The U.S. e-passport also has a new look, incorporating additional anti-fraud and security features. Since August 2007, the U.S. has been issuing only e-passports.” 4\n\nIf we see a face it we don’t recognize (you are not in the citizen database and not in the visitor database) then who are you? Why are you here? Of course this assumes of course an extremely high success rate with facial recognition – all of the scenarios I am describing will only work if there is a very very low error rate.\n\n### Not just Privacy vs. Security\n\nIn the end we all know there is a collision between privacy and security. Yet this is so much broader than many people realize. I do believe like all technology it has the power to make the world a better place when used responsibly.\n\n### References\n\n1.

        '\nYesterday I had the pleasure of mental stimulation. The theme of the TEDx OC conference was relevance. Specifically how do you stay relevant in today’s world?\n\nAs the day progressed this theme blossomed for me. I took away a number of new ideas and perspectives. I learned things from people whom I expected to learn things from but also from unexpected places, which quite frankly is the best kind of serendipity.\n\nRick Warren was the host in the late afternoon. Rick Warren is the founder of Saddleback Church. Today, it is an evangelical congregation averaging 22,000 weekly attendees, a 120-acre campus, and has more than 300 community ministries. He is large in stature as well as personality, but as the host I wasn’t thinking of him in the same manner as a presenter – subtle way of saying I wasn’t expecting much.\n\nIt’s obvious in hindsight that Rick must know some things about growing and nurturing an organization. When he spoke of relevance it was startlingly relevant! I took away two really great points and I thought I’d share them here. The first point is relevant to both you as a person, as well as organizations. Rick’s quote:\n\n\u003e “When the pace of change around you is faster than the pace of change\n\u003e inside you, you become irrelevant.”\n\nThe pace of change in the world is relentless and moving ever faster. In order to stay relevant you need to move at the same pace or better. If not, you fall behind. If you are a cyclist then you aren’t in the peloton anymore.\n\nObvious and simple right? But for me it’s highly relevant. My organization is changing and we are trying to do it as fast as possible. But at the same time we are trying to operate globally which adds coordination and slows decision making. How does an organization both move “at speed” and “as one” globally? This is a hard problem to solve. Social media, modern communications tools and other things may help but how to really accelerate?\n\nOne idea I loved was the point Rick made to “develop a lab mentality”. Never stop experimenting. Fail fast and move on. Now this is not new. I’ve heard from many, many innovators that innovation happens slowly, over time, via experimentation, openness and curiosity. The classic Thomas Edison story about the invention of the light bulb is how real innovation occurs.\n\nToday, many companies (if not all) are trying to be more innovative. But how? There are many great examples in the wild. For example in advertising you are starting to see “labs” emerge as a new nomenclature. Olgivy and BBH have created labs and I’ll use BBH’s as an example. Here is their mission and vision:\n\n\u003e Labs is BBH’s global innovation unit. We’re tasked with pioneering\n\u003e new outputs and approaches: exploring emerging platforms and behaviors\n\u003e on behalf of brands, and developing new agency models along the way.\n\u003e Our overall ambition is to find ways in which marketing innovation can\n\u003e be a powerful force for good (more effective, more engaging, more\n\u003e sustainable, more exciting).\n\nThe concept of adopting a lab mentality is in my view the only way for large organizations to become more innovative. Why?\n\n- A **dedicated lab** is necessary. The reason they need to be dedicated is that in an environment where the pace of change is so fast, it’s hard for people to adequately deal with the _present_, while at the same time imagining and developing the future.\n- The people and skills required to invent the future are **different** from “line” jobs in the organization.\n\nThe other key takeaway from Rick was his thoughts on grief. Yes, grief. Rick said something like this:\n\n1. **Growth requires change**. You cannot simply continue to do what you have always done. You are guaranteed to be irrelevant.\n2. **Change causes loss**. Change requires letting go of the past. It means ending old ways, old culture, old products, and even letting go of people who are no longer relevant to the organizations future. This causes a deep sense of loss.\n3. **Loss causes pain**. Letting go of the old and familiar in order the grab the new and different is hard. It is scary. It can be wrenching and painful and sad.\n4. **Loss and pain cause grief**. You must respect and honor grief. You must honor the past without perpetuating the past. Many people who you think are oppositional to change are just grieving. You must allow people to grieve and you must help them through the grieving period.\n\nThis gave me a whole new perspective on change and innovation. I know I am not wired for empathy. I struggle with grief. I never know what to say. I never know how to comfort someone who is grieving. I simply feel awkward and uncomfortable and alone. This means if I want to more effectively lead change I must also grow personally to able to honor someone’s grief. I love the use of the word “honor” – because I know I can do it. I can honor the grief someone feels when change is occurring.\n\nSo thanks Dr. Rick for giving me some needed perspective and adding to my serendipity at TEDx OC!\n\nReferences:\n\n- [http://www.rickwarren.com/about/rickwarren/](http://www.rickwarren.com/about/rickwarren/)\n- [http://bbh-labs.com/](http://bbh-labs.com/)\n- [http://influxinsights.com/2010/branding/why-agencies-need-labs/#](http://influxinsights.com/2010/branding/why-agencies-need-labs/#)\n',

        '\nI\'ve collected bits of information about Apple that I have found interesting and/or inspiring and could never really muster a cohesive post from them. But everytime I read them I felt inspired. Even the title of of this post is inspirational - To me it sums up Apple in six words.\n\nI decided to share my collection of notes in raw form below in the hopes they inspire you as well.\n\n\u003e I haven’t got any sort of odd chip on my shoulder about proving anything to myself or anybody else. And remember, though the outside world looks at success from a numerical point of view, my yardstick might be quite different than that. My yardstick may be how every computer that’s designed from here on out will have to be at least as good as a Macintosh.\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003ccite\u003e- Steve Jobs, 1985\u003c/cite\u003e\n\n---\n\n### Insanely Great\n\nMarket share and profitability are only outcomes. They are not Apple’s purpose; its mission is to achieve the "insanely great". It is as if they are on an ongoing Grail quest. (As Professor Henry Jones said to Indiana: "The search for the Grail is the search for the Divine in all of us.")\n\n---\n\n### Apple Advertising\n\n"As you probably know, there is a great deal of copy-catting in advertising and marketing. But here\'s the thing: when we present case studies of great marketing, we don\'t use Apple anymore because it is viewed as an outlier of such magnitude that many of us in the industry regard it as inimitable.\n\nOur clients feel like there is nothing to learn from Apple because if you could deliver \u0026#8211; with nearly every single product \u0026#8211; an amazing user experience, genuine technical innovations, uncompromisingly stylish packaging AND be backed by a company who is unafraid to pursue a singular vision vs. what the focus groups say, then it\'d be EASY to do great marketing because all you\'d have to do is a great product demo. Which, by the way, is exactly what most Apple product ads are."\n\n---\n\n### Apple Usability\n\n"I worked for Apple in New York City for a little over a year. Does the company want to push product? Yes. Does it want to make a profit? Of course. BUT it also has created life-changing technologies, particularly for those with disabilities.\n\nThere are voice-over features for those with vision issues, notepads and video communication features for those with hearing disabilities. I remember selling an iPhone to a woman who was blind and teaching her how to use the voice-over features and it was extraordinary. She is now able to be a part of this new wave of communication and inter-connectedness. I also remember a group of deaf men looking to upgrade their iPhones as well. Their fingers were flying across the screen as they were using the Notepad app to communicate with me (as someone not fluent in ASL). For many people these aren\'t just frivolous technologies, they truly change the way people are able to connect within our able-centric society. They create simple linkages where before there was frustrations, disadvantages, and impossibilities."\n\n---\n\n### Apple Style\n\n"This is certainly why my own conversion to Apple, and my deep loyalty to the company and its products, somehow felt comforting in the last decade. Their style elevates me, their power and reliability I have come to take for granted. Their stores have the innovation and beauty that a renewed Christianity would muster in its churches…"\n\n"But if those translucent, airy, elegant stores do not evoke a secular kind of church, then I don\'t know what does. "Style" is in some ways the most sublime and mysterious of product attributes. And nothing beats Apple\'s style."\n\n---\n\n### Apple Accountability\n\nOne lesson could be called the "Difference between the Janitor and the Vice President," and it\'s a sermon Jobs delivers every time an executive reaches the VP level. Jobs imagines his garbage regularly not being emptied in his office, and when he asks the janitor why, he gets an excuse: The locks have been changed, and the janitor doesn\'t have a key. This is an acceptable excuse coming from someone who empties trash bins for a living. The janitor gets to explain why something went wrong. Senior people do not.\n\n"When you’re the janitor," Jobs has repeatedly told incoming VPs, "reasons matter." He continues: "Somewhere between the janitor and the CEO, reasons stop mattering." That "Rubicon," he has said, "is crossed when you become a VP." (Apple has about 70 vice presidents out of more than 25,000 non-retail-store employees.)\n\nJobs indoctrinates a culture of responsibility by hosting a series of weekly meetings that are the metronome that sets the beat for the entire company. On Mondays he meets with his executive management team to discuss results and strategy as well as to review nearly every important project in the company. On Wednesdays he holds a marketing and communications meeting. Simplicity breeds clarity, as Jobs himself explained in a 2008 interview with Fortune.\n\n\u003e "Every Monday we review the whole business," he said. "We look at\n\u003e every single product under development. I put out an agenda.\n\u003e Eighty percent is the same as it was the last week, and we just\n\u003e walk down it every single week. We don’t have a lot of process at\n\u003e Apple, but that’s one of the few things we do just to all stay on\n\u003e the same page."\n\nThe accountability mindset extends down the ranks. At Apple there is never any confusion as to who is responsible for what. Internal Applespeak even has a name for it, the "DRI,"" or directly responsible individual. Often the DRI\'s name will appear on an agenda for a meeting, so everybody knows who is responsible. "Any effective meeting at Apple will have an action list," says a former employee. "Next to each action item will be the DRI." A common phrase heard around Apple when someone is trying to learn the right contact on a project: "Who\'s the DRI on that?"\n\n_Lashinsky, Adam (2011). Inside Apple \u0026#8212; From Steve Jobs down to the janitor: How America\'s most successful \u0026#8211; and most secretive \u0026#8211; big company really works._\n\n---\n\n### Remembering Steve Jobs\n\n![Jony Ive](/assets/blog/img/jony_ive.jpg)\n\n_Following Steve Jobs’s death on October 5, 2011, Sir Jony Ive wrote this remembrance in which he reflects on the spirit of their collaboration. These words inspire me deeply in ways I cannot completely express. I added this section on October 5th, 2021 on the tenth anniversary of Steve\'s passing._\n\n\u003e "He was without doubt the most inquisitive human I have ever met. His insatiable curiosity was not limited or distracted by his knowledge or expertise, nor was it casual or passive. It was ferocious, energetic and restless. His curiosity was practiced with intention and rigor.\n\u003e\n\u003e Many of us have an innate predisposition to be curious. I believe that after a traditional education, or working in an environment with many people, curiosity is a decision requiring intent and discipline.\n\u003e\n\u003e In larger groups our conversations gravitate towards the tangible, the measurable. It is more comfortable, far easier and more socially acceptable talking about what is known. Being curious and exploring tentative ideas were far more important to Steve than being socially acceptable.\n\u003e\n\u003e Our curiosity begs that we learn. And for Steve, wanting to learn was far more important than wanting to be right.\n\u003e\n\u003e Our curiosity united us. It formed the basis of our joyful and productive collaboration.

        '\n\u003e Apple’s announcements at this year’s WWDC keynote will have far reaching effects. Much has already been written about the impacts to you and me as consumers of Apple products. But let’s stop and think for a moment about how this will affect our perceptions about technology, and how that will translate into the corporate IT space.\n\n### Apple’s Vision\n\nWith Google, the company perhaps most associated with the cloud, the approach starts with a common business scenario and then applies it to the “cloud”. They’re extending familiar concepts. Google Docs is Microsoft Office, but in the cloud. Gmail is Outlook, but in the cloud.\n\nGoogle seems to be aiming for users who understand current computing paradigms and are able to apply that knowledge to “the cloud”. Power users, if you will. Many of the people reading this post are in this camp.\n\nCorporate IT is in this camp, and feels very comfortable with the Google approach because it’s a like-for-like comparison. It simply becomes a discussion of cost, features, and security. In the case of Google corporate IT has a few “silver bullets” because Google’s vision is so cloud focused. So far Google’s vision is that everything is always there because everything only exists in the cloud. So what happens when you are in an airplane with no internet access (flying through the real clouds with no metaphorical cloud access)?\n\nApple’s approach to the concept of the cloud is the opposite of Google’s. As you know, at Apple conferences focus is on the demos so here’s the iCloud demo: You’re working on a document in Pages on your iPad, you move over to Pages on your Mac, and there it is. It even remembers where you were last editing. You download a song to your iPhone, you pick up your iPad, and there it is. With iPad/iPhone and now OS X Lion, you don’t even save documents anymore. They save automatically. Apple’s view is consumers have absolutely no idea what the cloud is, don’t care, and shouldn’t care.\n\nApple’s vision is all your “stuff” just exists, in real-time, on all your devices.\n\nApple view is the cloud to a place that only exists in the background. You never interact with it, your apps do — and you never even realize it. It’s magic. “It all just works.” “Automatically” - Steve Jobs kept saying this over and over again on stage. When Steve does this, it’s never an accident. It’s a message.\n\nApple has been going out of their way to avoid using the word “syncing” with regard to iCloud. That implies that files exist in one place and need to be moved and/or copied. That’s way too technical for the story Apple is weaving. Files are something Microsoft worries about. Files in the cloud are something Google worries about.\n\nApple’s iCloud is about picking up any (Apple) device you happen to have, opening any (Apple) application you want and voila! The thing you want to access being right there, right where you left off. “It all just works”. “Automatically”.\n\n### The Impact of Apple’s Vision on Corporate IT\n\nMost people I know use email as the “poor man’s” iCloud. When working on a document they send it to themselves in email. Using email, they can usually access the document on their home computer, iPad, iPhone or other device, and hopefully continue editing it. Then when done, save it again and email it back to themselves. Thus ensuring corporate email is hopelessly bloated, and also ensuring corporate security is hopelessly paranoid about what is contained in everyone’s inbox.\n\nI have found a slightly better way using DropBox (there is also Box.com) as the corporate “poor man’s” iCloud. I have DropBox loaded on my work provided Laptop, my home PC, my iPad and my iPhone. When I am actively working on a document I place it in my DropBox folder and DropBox takes care of syncing it to all my devices “automatically”.\n\nIn theory I can just open it up on the device I happen to be using at the time and continue editing. But not all editors on all devices are equal, and I have to remember to save the file myself, and when I open the file on another device it does not know where I last was in the document. But, it is still a huge step forward from the email approach.\n\nBut what happens when my corporate clients start using iCloud on their Apple devices? Their perceptions and expectations will be forever changed. Their view of the current corporate IT approach is that we are already far behind the “consumerization” trends. What will our response be?\n\nSome companies are going the opposite direction – lock everything down and don’t let any data ever leave the corporate data center. We all know how this ends – you can never put the genie back in the bottle.\n\nI think there is a huge opportunity for DropBox, or a company like DropBox, to help us extend corporate IT out in a secure way and bridge the Apple and non-Apple worlds.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nSource:\n\n[Apple iCloud](http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/08/apple-icloud-google-cloud/)\n',

        "\nLike many people in the Technology world I watched Apple's iPad announcement this week with intense interest. Unlike most people I am interested not in the consumer space - but rather how could this device be used for business. How could a new category like this be used?\n\n### Opportunities for the iPad in financial services\n\nThose who stand to benefit the most from the iPad are financial advisers who are constantly meeting clients on the go, says Doug Dannemiller, senior analyst at Aite Group.\n\nFor advisers, **data visualization and presentation** are key. And one of the most interesting aspects of the iPad is its zoom and flip page capabilities, which means it can be shared with a client more easily than a laptop, Dannemiller points out.\n\n“I see the laptop as not a good collaborative tool,” he explains. A laptop computer acts as a barrier between the adviser and client, since it is only one person (presumably the adviser) who will handle the keyboard, hit the return key and flip the computer round to face the client.\n\nOn the other hand, with an iPad, you can reach over and touch the screen, instead of having to navigate with a button or a mouse.\n“With the iPad, an adviser could navigate better, sweep pages across, look at a client’s financial plan and statements, and work more collaboratively side by side. It’s a subtle difference. The touch-screen means you can sit on the same side of the table, work as a partner,” Dannemiller adds.\n\n“I’ve seen apps for the iPhone , such as the Bloomberg app, which are quite strong, where you can drill in to pie charts to see the next layer of detail,” he says. “I can see these apps being used on the iPad, where people can navigate personal financial information.”\n\nThe iPad’s media integration capabilities make it particularly attractive for financial advisers, adds Todd Christy, president and CTO, Pyxis Mobile.\n\nThe device’s rich text, enhanced reader application, combined with a large bright screen and embedded video, make it a great tool for presentations, Christy points out.\n\n“For us, we would expect to be consuming content from Thomson Reuters and embedding it in a business context. We would have clients holdings, a chart of asset allocation, and a chief equity analyst speaking about positions relevant to the client’s portfolio. Technically you can do that on the iPhone, but sharing the information [on the iPad] with the client in a personal way across a couch or table, hasn’t really existed before.\n\n### Apple's plans\n\nClearly iWork is a nod to users who need to get work done using an iPad. Pages, Numbers, and Keynote cover word processing, spreadsheet, and presentation tasks. The iPad can also be attached to a projector to give a presentation directly from the device. You can still import and export files compatible with Microsoft's Word, Excel, and Powerpoint, just like you can with the desktop versions. Conceivably Microsoft could develop iPad versions of Office apps if it determines that the demand was there.\n\nBy using the iPhone OS as a starting point the iPad gains the enterprise features of iPhone OS, including Exchange ActiveSync support for e-mail, contacts, and calendars. But according to AppleInsider's sources, Apple has some enterprise-friendly features planned for the iPad that haven't yet been publicly announced. One feature is a planned ability to access standard file servers on a local network. The other is the ability to print to networked printers. Combined with Office-compatible iWork apps, an iPad could be useful for many routine business tasks.\n\n### Considerations\n\n#### Pros\n\n- Marketing/Branding/Image – nothing will say “leading edge” like pulling out an iPad. We all know there is power in brand association and Apple is a very powerful brand.\n- Built-in 3G wireless – makes the device compelling compared to a netbook with additional wireless card/modem.\n  Lower support costs: Apple’s “walled garden” for apps means the devices stay stable and fast.\n- Lower training costs: we all know Apple's devices require little to no end-user training and Apple provides \"how to\" videos via Apple academy that could be loaded on to the device\n\n#### Cons\n\n- Security – this is a big issue and a potential show stopper. Since the device runs a version of the iPhone OS I assume it can be connected to our email system (Exchange) and we can remote wipe the machine if it is lost (assuming it remains connected to a network). However alternative messaging paths cannot be controlled, loading apps cannot be controlled so other messaging and social medial (gmail, facebook, etc.) will be wide open.\n\n#### Unknowns\n\n- Size: Is a 9.7” screen large enough? If one of our externals is consuming content from Apollo on the screen does it really work? Most indications are that content providers are redesigning their content specifically for that screen.\n- Durability: How well would the device stand up to the rigors of travel?\n\n### Summary\n\nThis is a very real possibility for the externals in lieu of a netbook.\n\nCorporate Requirements:\n\n- The ability to create a corporate whitelist or blacklist of apps that employees are allowed to use, either specific apps or categories of apps\n- Connect to corporate email\n- Policy enforcement: password ( even better would some type of sync where I use my corporate password )\n- Remote wipe\n- Encryption\n- Can work without having to ever connect to a desktop.\n\n### The trojan horse approach\n\nHow about using the iPad as a \"thin client\" (pun intended!) and running a full install of Windows 7 on the iPad? It turns out the 9.7 inch display on the iPad with a 1024x768 screen resolution works great for a full VDI XenDesktop (Citrix). Windows desktops and applications run unmodified and securely in the data center. The advancements that were made for the Citrix Receiver for iPhone will carry over to the iPad, however the iPhone restrictions of screen size and small keyboard are overcome with the iPad.\n\nWhat you are seeing in the picture is Windows 7 running on the iPad SDK simulator, thanks to Citrix Receiver and XenDesktop 4—running meaning that it's executed on a server and remotely displayed on the iPad at full resolution.The iPad looks like it might work as and end point device where corporate IT will be able to safely deliver company hosted virtual desktops and apps without worry. How cool would that be?\n\nSources:\n\n- [Apple Business Manager](https://www.apple.com/business/it/)\n- [Apple may have business-friendly iPad features up its sleeve](http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2010/01/apple-may-have-business-friendly-ipad-features-up-its-sleeve.ars?utm_source=rss\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=rss)\n",

        '\nMy assistant Kathy told me today about donating to Haitian relief efforts by simply sending a text message from my cellphone. The Red Cross, via a company called mGive, has got the major U.S. carriers on board to allow people to very easily donate $10 to the Red Cross via a simple SMS text message.\n\nThis led to an "unprecedented mobile response," and has raised over $10 million in relief for Haiti. With text donations peaking at a rate of 10,000 a minute, at $10 per donation, this is raising $100,000 per minute!\n\nI had been watching the news about Haiti and was heartbroken at what they are going through. I wanted to help. But did I?\n\n**Wanting to donate** and **actually donating** are two different things. Deciding the amount, finding my checkbook, writing a check, finding an envelope and stamp, addressing the envelope, mailing it – well frankly it was exhausting just typing all those steps. Not only that but it\'s hard to imagine finding 10 minutes in my day to actually do it! This new process cut that time down to less than 30 seconds!\n\n\u003e **NOTE:** If you want to donate simply text HAITI to the number 90999. A $10 charge will be added to your next cellphone bill.\n\nOne of the reasons text messaging is so popular is because it’s so simple. Anyone with just about any kind of mobile device can do it. And that’s precisely why it is ingenious to use this mechanism for donations.\n\nBy making things easy for people we overcome our natural human “inertia”. This is exactly why I love shopping at Amazon.com. Because of their patented “one-click” ordering and Amazon Prime, which basically gets you products super-fast without worrying about shipping, I buy everything from Amazon, with rare exception – even when they are NOT the best price. Why? I like shopping with them. The experience is flawless, and few things in life are flawless.\n\nOf course another great company comes immediately to mind - want to venture a guess? Apple Computer. I\'m a corporate technology person yet in our four person household we have 4 iPhones, several iPods, and three Mac Computers. Why? Mainly because it is much easier for their helpdesk (Me). They can figure it out on their own! One could make a strong argument that Apple “won” the MP3 player wars with two weapons – the iPod and its incredible user interface, and iTunes which made getting music on your device simple. I consider it a hallmark of modern technology when we can create human interfaces that are so intuitive, like an iPod Touch, that a three year old could use it.\n\nThere are huge opportunities here for corporate IT. Just a couple examples to get your creative juices flowing:\n\nMaking things easier for our clients:\n\n- How about “one-click” investing?\n- Your account “Tweets” when the balance is low?\n\nMaking things easier for our employees:\n\n- How about sending a text message to get your password reset?\n- How about implementing UI’s on corporate systems that are as well designed and easy to learn as an iPod?\n\nNone of this is easy - but "ease of use" always wins in the end!\n\n### References\n\n- [ABC News: Haiti Earthquake Donations](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/HaitiEarthquake/haiti-earthquake-donations-haiti-relief-efforts-text-message/story?id=9551199)\n',
